Syntax: No functions.
Description: This file imports the necessary libraries for developing a voice model using deep learning and speech synthesis. These include os and librosa for locating and loading voice samples, TensorFlow for building the model, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib for visualizing the data. Additional libraries will be imported as needed in the subsequent steps of the process.

Syntax: No functions, main program statements only.
Description: This script imports vital libraries for creating a voice model. The TensorFlow library is used to build the machine learning model, Librosa library is leveraged to load and process audio files while Numpy for numerical operations. Matplotlib is imported for the purpose of visualizing spectrograms. Other libraries such as Sklearn will be imported in the future as required.
