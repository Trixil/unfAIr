Message: I understand the task, I will now create the Python script for scanning the directory and listing the files. 

File name: scan_directory.py
Code: 
```python
import os

try:
    # Path to the directory containing the voice samples
    path_to_directory = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09' 
    
    # List to store files in directory
    files_in_directory = [] 
    
    # Loop over the files in directory
    for file_name in os.listdir(path_to_directory):
        # Append files to the list 
        files_in_directory.append(file_name)

    print("Files listed in the directory:", files_in_directory)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The specified directory could not be found. Please check that your path_to_directory is correct.")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any other exceptions that weren't handled by the previous except blocks
    print("An error occurred: ", e)
```
