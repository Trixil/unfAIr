Message: The necessary code for the task will involve obtaining each file in the designated directories, determining their current format, and converting them to the .wav or .mp3 format if they are not currently in that format. The Python libraries we can use for this could be the os library for manipulation of the file system and PyDub, a simple and easy-to-use library, to convert audio files.

Message: Let's write the script to convert sound samples to a suitable format if they are not already.

File name: convert_audio_format.py
Code:
```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
import os

def convert_to_mp3(wav_file_path, target_folder):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(wav_file_path)
    mp3_file_path = os.path.join(target_folder, os.path.basename(wav_file_path).replace('.wav', '.mp3'))
    audio.export(mp3_file_path, format="mp3")

def convert_audio_files_in_dir(dir_path, target_format="mp3"):
    supported_formats = ["wav", "mp3"]
    if target_format not in supported_formats:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported target format: {target_format}. Choose from {supported_formats}")

            convert_to_mp3(current_file_path, dir_path)

convert_audio_files_in_dir('path_to_your_directory')
```
In the above code, we are defining two functions. The `convert_to_mp3` function takes `wav_file_path` and `target_folder` as input and converts the WAV file to MP3. The `convert_audio_files_in_dir` function is looping through each file in the input directory. If the file is not already in the target format, it calls the `convert_to_mp3` function to convert. In the end, the function `convert_audio_files_in_dir` is called with a placeholder path.

Fetch: convert_sound_samples.py
Message: After analyzing the given 'convert_sound_samples.py' code, the code seems quite efficient already with necessary error handling to avoid crashes. However, a few potential improvements could make the function more reusable and user-friendly. Here are the proposed changes:

1. Function Input Parameters: The code has the directory hardcoded. Adding the directory as a function parameter would allow the function to be used for other directories as well.

2. Conversion Format Definition: Instead of automatically converting the files to mp3, we could add the conversion format as a parameter as well. The function could have a default value (for instance, an mp3) for the parameter in case it's not provided.

3. Return Value: The function could return a Boolean success flag and a list of files that encountered errors during conversion. This could be useful for users to deal with these problematic files.

These improvements may make the function more flexible and provide more feedback to the user about the conversion process. Now, let's implement these changes in the code.
