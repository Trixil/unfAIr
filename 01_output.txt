Message: For the first task, I will write a Python script that uses the os module for directory traversal and file extraction. This script will traverse the designated directory and output a list of all the audio files found, as well as the total number.

File name: extract_voice_samples.py
Code: 
```python
import os

def extract_voice_samples(directory):
    # List all files in the given directory
    file_list = os.listdir(directory)
    
    # Filter list to only include .ogg files (assuming voice samples are in .ogg format)
    audio_files = [file for file in file_list if file.endswith('.ogg')]
    
    total_files = len(audio_files)
    
    # Print out total number of audio files
    print(f"Total number of audio files: {total_files}")
    
    # Return list of audio files
    return audio_files

# Replace the below directory with the actual directory path
directory = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'

extract_voice_samples(directory)
```

Message: The request requires the update of the provided script to include exception handling mechanisms. The exceptions to be handled include directory errors (like non-existence or permission errors), and file type checking to ensure the script looks for .ogg files only. I will write an updated version of this script that addresses these exceptions.
File name: extract_voice_samples_with_exceptions.py
Code: 
```python
import os

def extract_voice_samples(directory):
    audio_files = []
    total_files = 0
    
    try:
        # List all files in the given directory
        file_list = os.listdir(directory)
        
        # Filter list to only include .ogg files (assuming voice samples are in .ogg format)
        audio_files = [file for file in file_list if file.endswith('.ogg')]
        
        total_files = len(audio_files)
        
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The directory {directory} does not exist.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: You do not have permission to access the files in {directory}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}")
    
    # Print out total number of audio files
    print(f"Total number of audio files: {total_files}")
    
    # Return list of audio files
    return audio_files

# Replace the below directory with the actual directory path
directory = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'

extract_voice_samples(directory)
```
Update the directory with the actual directory path before running the script. In the case of an error, the script will print a message indicating the problem without breaking execution.

Message: As instructed, I will now write a script containing the function to process the extracted voice files. The function will transcribe the audio file and timestamp each word. The SpeechRecognition module will be used for the transcription process. The function will also handle exceptions for file access issues. The output will primarily be a list of transcriptions with corresponding timestamps.

File name: transcribe_audio_files.py

Code:
```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import ogg.vorbis 
import os 

def transcribe_audio_file(file_path):
    """Function to transcribe an audio file and timestamp each word """
    # Initialize recognizer class (for recognizing the speech)
    r = sr.Recognizer()

    # Exception Handling for file access issues
    try:
        file_checker = os.path.splitext(file_path)[1]
        if file_checker != '.ogg':
            raise Exception('File is not of .ogg type')
        
        # Reading Audio file as source
        # Listening the audio file and store in audio_text variable
        with ogg.vorbis.open(file_path, 'rb') as source:
            audio_text = r.listen(source)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file {file_path} was not found.")
        return None
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"You do not have permission to access the file {file_path}.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred with the file {file_path}: {str(e)}")
        return None

    # Recoginize_() method will throw a request error if the API is unreachable, hence using exception handling
    try:
        # Using google speech recognition
        print('Converting Audio Transcriptions from Google Speech Recognition')
        transcriptions = r.recognize_google(audio_text, show_all=True)
        print('Transcription completed')
        return transcriptions
