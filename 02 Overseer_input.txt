Message: Proceeding with constructing the initial base for the text-to-speech engine without any file reference.
File name: text_to_speech_engine.py
Code: 
```python
# Importing required libraries
import os
import sys
import pyttsx3

# Initiate the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Set properties for the speech such as voice, speed, volume etc.
# Set default voice to the system default voice
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)

# Set default speed to moderate speed
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)

# Set default volume to maximum
engine.setProperty('volume', 1.0)

# Function to convert text to speech
def text_to_speech(user_text):
    # Passing the text to the engine
    engine.say(user_text)
    # Blocking method which will not return until the queued say() calls have completed the speech
    engine.runAndWait()

# This is a skeleton of the code. Further functionalities and improvements will be added later.
```To-do:
1. Construct the text-to-speech processing engine that translates user's text inputs into synthesized vocal outputs - Not Started
2. Write a script that can categorize words into phonetic components - Not Started
3. Make use of voice samples from the voice directory to learn and mimic a particular character's voice - Not Started
4. Combine the scripts provided with executable instructions given to the user - Not Started

Message: Based on the stated objectives, I will proceed to write a script that analyzes words into their phonetic components. For this task, we can leverage the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a package in Python that provides tools for handling and processing text. It contains a CMU Pronouncing Dictionary that we can use to break down words into phonemes.

File name: phonetic_components_analyzer.py
Code: 
```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import cmudict 

# Initialize the CMU Dict
nltk.download('cmudict')
phonetic_dict = cmudict.dict()

def phonetic_components(word):
    """
    This function accepts a word as a string, 
    breaks it down into its phonetic components using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary,
    and returns the phonetic components as a list.
    """
    try:
        phonemes = phonetic_dict[word.lower()]
        return phonemes
    except:
        return "Word not found in CMU Pronunciation Dictionary."

```To-do:
1. Construct the text-to-speech processing engine that translates user's text inputs into synthesized vocal outputs - In Progress
2. Write a script that can categorize words into phonetic components - Not Started
3. Make use of voice samples from the voice directory to learn and mimic a particular character's voice - Not Started
4. Combine the scripts provided with executable instructions given to the user - Not Started
