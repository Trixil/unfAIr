02 Overseer: Update the to-do list with each conversation with 02 and output it in your To-do field
02 Overseer: Message: I will create a basic script using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library in Python. This script will include a function to input the text and convert it into speech.
File name: basic_text_to_speech.py
Code: 
```python
from gtts import gTTS
import os

def text_to_speech(text, lang='en', slow=False):
    speech = gTTS(text=text, lang=lang, slow=slow)
    speech.save('generated_speech.mp3')

# Running example
text = "Hello, this is a text to speech conversion demo"
text_to_speech(text)
```To-do: 
1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Pending)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (pending)
3. Use statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo - (Pending)
4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01fs output - (Pending)
5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Pending)

Current instruction for you: 

Start by writing the basic shell of the text-to-speech algorithm using common available libraries. This shell should include methods for inputting text that will be converted into speec

Current instruction for you: 

The basic text-to-speech functionality has been implemented. Now, implement a method within your script to alter the attributes of the speech audio such as pitch, frequency, and tempo. First, focus on adjusting the pitch of the speech generated from the input text. Make sure you create an object-oriented structure for future expansion of the program
02 Overseer: Message: Implementing the functionality to adjust the frequency of the synthesized speech using the `pydub` library and maintaining the object-oriented structure of the code.

```python
import pyttsx3
import os 
from pydub import AudioSegment

class TextToSpeech:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = pyttsx3.init()
        self.sound = None
        

    def convert_text_to_speech(self, text):

        self.engine.runAndWait()

        # create AudioSegment object from the wav file
        self.sound = AudioSegment.from_file('speech.wav')

    def alter_pitch(self, percentage):
        # Alter pitch up by a percentage
        if percentage > 0:
            self.sound = self.sound.speedup(playback_speed=(percentage/100)+1)

        file_handle = self.sound.export("altered_pitch_speech.wav", format="wav")

    def alter_frequency(self, percentage):
        # Alter frequency up by a percentage
        if percentage > 0:
            self.sound = self.sound.speedup(playback_speed=(percentage/100)+1)
            # Remove transitions between segments
            self.sound = self.sound.crossfade(0)
        # Alter frequency down by a percentage
        elif percentage < 0:
            self.sound = self.sound.slowdown(1-abs(percentage/100))
            # Remove transitions between segments

        file_handle = self.sound.export("altered_frequency_speech.wav", format="wav")
```
Please note that altering pitch and frequency risks introducing discontinuities between segments of sound. I used the `crossfade(0)` method to remove transitions between segments for the frequency alterations, giving each segment a sharp ending and beginning which may smooth out the audio. Return to me if any further adjustments are required.To-do: 
1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Completed)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (Ongoing: Pitch Completed)
3. Use statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo - (Pending)
4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01fs output - (Pending)

Current instruction for you: 

Great, pitch modification has been implemented successfully. Let's proceed to the next feature - frequency adjustment. Implement a method to adjust the frequency of the synthesized speech audio using the `pydub` library. Remember to maintain the object-oriented structure
02 Overseer: Message: The fetched code will be edited to add a tempo adjustment feature. The 'alter_tempo' function will be implemented, using the pydub's speedup and slowdown features based on the user's input. The updated code will be re-saved under the same name.
