It creates an object of gTTS, specifies the name of the audio file, and saves the speech audio into a file. The function finally returns the audio file. It utilizes the 'gTTS' Python library to interact with Google's Text-to-Speech API, and requires an active internet for this.\n******\nUsers can copy this documentation and append it to their existing user_documentation.txt file for maintaining a sequential record of their code files and related documentation.

It works similarly to the previous function `match_word_to_sample`, but with an additional step of considering the context of each word in the sentence.\n\nThe function now uses three lists as its resources - 'word_list', \u2018context_list\u2019, and 'audio_files'. The 'context_list\u2019 is a new list introduced, which corresponds to the 'word_list' and contains the context of each word.\n\nThe function goes through each word in the sentence. If a word is found in 'word_list\u2019, it checks if its preceding word matches the corresponding context. If it matches, it appends the contextual voice sample to the `matched_samples` list; otherwise, it appends the normal voice sample. Finally, it returns the 'matched_samples' list.\n\nFor the demonstration purpose, if the context matches, it appends an audio file with suffix '_context.ogg'. In a real-world scenario, it should select the most appropriate voice sample file based on matching context.\n\nPlease note that this function also handles only case-sensitive exact matches, and it considers only the immediately preceding word as the context word for each word in the sentence.\n\n******\n\nFile name: contextual_voice_sample_mapping.py\nSyntax: \n- Function name: match_word_to_sample_context(sentence)\n- Input: sentence (str): The sentence to be spoken.\n- Output: matched_samples (list): List of filenames of the contextual voice samples corresponding to the words in the sentence.\n\nDescription: This function breaks down the input sentence into words, and for each word, considers its preceded word as its context. It matches each word and the context with its corresponding lists 'word_list' and 'context_list'. According to the matching status, it appends the appropriate voice sample from 'audio_files' list to the 'matched_samples' list, which is finally returned by the function. For now, it assumes the audio files ending with '_context.ogg' are the voice samples considering the context, and other remaining '.ogg' files are normal voice samples. The next update should include the proper implementation of these voice samples selection process.\n******\n******\nFile name: assemble_samples.py\nContent:  language model, I don't have the ability to maintain or access files such as user_documentation.txt.

In order to achieve this, I need the documented descriptions of all the functions from the files like `build_voice_model.py`, `contextual_voice_sample_mapping.py`, `assemble_samples.py` or any other remaining files used in our tasks. Following this, I need you to provide the function name, syntax, input & output details, and a clear, concise description for each function belonging to any remaining undocumented file, or any other function from the already documented files if they haven't been documented yet.\n\nAs a reminder, the format is as follows:\n\n```\nFile name: (Your file's name here)\nSyntax:\n- Function name:\n- Input(s):\n- Output(s):\nDescription:\n```\n\nWith this, we'll be able to move forward to create a user manual detailing how to operate the finished program.

It assumes the audio files are in .ogg format. This script will handle exceptions caused by invalid file paths, absence of .ogg files and issues with file permissions.\n******\n******\nFile name: extract_voice_samples_with_exceptions.py\nContent: ile name: extract_voice_samples_with_exceptions.py\nSyntax: \n- Function name: extract_voice_samples(directory)\n- Input: Directory path as a string.\n- Output: A list containing voice sample file names and prints the total count of the audio files.\n\nDescription: This Python script locates and counts all voice sample files in a given directory. It is an updated form of the previous function with added exception handling features. The function specifically accounts for file errors such as non-existing directories or files, access permission issues, and unexpected errors. This function assumes the audio files are in .ogg format.\n******\n******\nFile name: transcribe_audio_files.py\nContent: ile name: transcribe_audio_files.py\nSyntax: \n- Function name: transcribe_audio_file(file_path)\n- Input: Path of the audio file as a string.\n- Output: Transcriptions of the audio file with timestamps. \n\nDescription: This script processes the extracted voice files, taking an audio file and transcribing it. Upon completion, the function timestamps each word within the transcription. The Google SpeechRecognition module is used for the transcription process. This script will handle exceptions caused by invalid .ogg file paths, access permission issues, and issues with the internet connection. \n******\n******\nFile name: (file name of entry)\nContent:  am an AI language model and cannot handle physical files or maintain a user_documentation.txt file as you have instructed.

It creates an object of gTTS, specifies the name of the audio file, and saves the speech audio into a file. The function finally returns the audio file. It utilizes the 'gTTS' Python library to interact with Google's Text-to-Speech API, and requires an active internet for this.\n******\nUsers can copy this documentation and append it to their existing user_documentation.txt file for maintaining a sequential record of their code files and related documentation. Please remember to install necessary modules 'gTTS' and 'playsound' before executing the script.\n******\nFile name: contextual_voice_sample_mapping.py\nContent: e: contextual_voice_sample_mapping.py\nCode:\n```python\n# Placeholder lists\nword_list = ['hello', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'john']\ncontext_list = ['goodbye', 'your', 'nickname', 'are', 'doe']\naudio_files = ['audio1.ogg', 'audio2.ogg', 'audio3.ogg', 'audio4.ogg', 'audio5.ogg']\n\ndef match_word_to_sample_context(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to breakdown the sentence into words and match each word with its corresponding voice sample considering context.\n\n    Parameters:\n    sentence (str): The sentence to be spoken.\n\n    Returns:\n    matched_samples (list): List of filenames of the audio files corresponding to the words in the sentence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Break down the sentence into words\n    sentence_words = sentence.split()\n\n    # Initialize matched_samples list\n    matched_samples = []\n\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the previous word\n    previous_word = None\n  \n    # Loop through each word in the sentence\n    for word in sentence_words:\n        \n        # If the word in the sentence matches a word in the word_list\n        if word in word_list:\n            # and if the previous word matches the context of this word\n            index = word_list.index(word)\n            if previous_word == context_list[index]:\n                matched_samples.append(f\"{audio_files[index]}_context.ogg\")\n            else:\n                matched_samples.append(audio_files[index])\n        \n        # Keep track of this word as the previous word for the next iteration\n        previous_word = word\n  \n    return matched_samples\n```\nIn the script mentioned above, we incorporate the context information into our function `match_word_to_sample_context`. It works similarly to the previous function `match_word_to_sample`, but with an additional step of considering the context of each word in the sentence.\n\nThe function now uses three lists as its resources - 'word_list', \u2018context_list\u2019, and 'audio_files'. The 'context_list\u2019 is a new list introduced, which corresponds to the 'word_list' and contains the context of each word.\n\nThe function goes through each word in the sentence. If a word is found in 'word_list\u2019, it checks if its preceding word matches the corresponding context. If it matches, it appends the contextual voice sample to the `matched_samples` list; otherwise, it appends the normal voice sample. Finally, it returns the 'matched_samples' list.\n\nFor the demonstration purpose, if the context matches, it appends an audio file with suffix '_context.ogg'. In a real-world scenario, it should select the most appropriate voice sample file based on matching context.\n\nPlease note that this function also handles only case-sensitive exact matches, and it considers only the immediately preceding word as the context word for each word in the sentence.\n\n******\n\nFile name: contextual_voice_sample_mapping.py\nSyntax: \n- Function name: match_word_to_sample_context(sentence)\n- Input: sentence (str): The sentence to be spoken.\n- Output: matched_samples (list): List of filenames of the contextual voice samples corresponding to the words in the sentence.\n\nDescription: This function breaks down the input sentence into words, and for each word, considers its preceded word as its context. It matches each word and the context with its corresponding lists 'word_list' and 'context_list'. According to the matching status, it appends the appropriate voice sample from 'audio_files' list to the 'matched_samples' list, which is finally returned by the function. For now, it assumes the audio files ending with '_context.ogg' are the voice samples considering the context, and other remaining '.ogg' files are normal voice samples. The next update should include the proper implementation of these voice samples selection process.\n******\n******\nFile name: assemble_samples.py\nContent:  language model, I don't have the ability to maintain or access files such as user_documentation.txt.

It then outputs an assembled .ogg audio file. The function currently does not handle actual audio files but returns a string of filenames separated by commas to demonstrate its logical functionality. The full implementation should work with actual .ogg files to concatenate them into a single audio file.\n******\n\nThis completes point 4 on your to-do list:\n\n1.
