Remember to write clean, understandable code and document each stage of your process for clarity and future reference.\n\n02: Text-to-Speech Interface\nInstructions: You are tasked with developing an interface for our text-to-speech program. Start by importing necessary libraries for GUI development. Create a user-friendly layout that takes text input from the user. This text input should be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks or other abuses of the interface. Build a function to pass this user's text to the voice model for speech synthesis. Integrate the voice model created by 01 into this interface. The system should generate a playable audio file or stream from the synthesized voice.
