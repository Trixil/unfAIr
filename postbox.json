Extract sample rate and data from each file using \"wave\" or \"soundfile\" library - (Completed)\n4. Normalize the data - (Completed)\n5. Store the data efficiently for later processing - (In-progress)\nI have updated the user_documentation.txt file with the newly provided 'save_normalized_audio_data' function.\n******\nFile name: save_normalized_audio_data.py\nSyntax: \n1. save_normalized_audio_data(data_dict, directory='normalized_files'): \n    Input: data_dict - a dictionary where each key is a file path, and its corresponding value is another dictionary with two keys, 'data' and 'rate'. 'data' holds the audio data, and 'rate' holds the sample rate. \n           directory - directory path where \".npy\" files will be saved (default is 'normalized_files').\n    Output: None, but saves each dictionary entry into a separate \".npy\" file in the given directory, with the original file path's directory separators replaced with underscores and the original file extension replaced with '.npy'.\n\nDescription: This module contains the function save_normalized_audio_data that takes a dictionary of normalized audio data and a directory path. It saves each audio data as a \".npy\" file in the given directory, after replacing the directory separators in the file path with underscores, removing the original file extension, and appending '.npy'. If the directory does not exist, it creates one.\n******\nFile name: \nCode: "

         "content": "In order to further progress on our script for creating audio software in Python, the task of storing normalized audio data efficiently has been started. The function 'save_normalized_audio_data' has been implemented to take care of this process, which is outlined in the file 'save_normalized_audio_data.py'.\n\nThe function is designed to save the normalized audio data in a compact manner in numpy .npy files. The location of these stored files can be designated by the user through a directory argument; if not provided, the function defaults to the directory 'normalized_files'. Importantly, the function ensures file naming compatibility by replacing original file directory separators with underscores and removing the original file extension.\n\nThe provided logic appears sound and proper, transforming file paths like 'Umineko/sound/voice/09/FILE.ogg' into 'Umineko_sound_voice_09_FILE.npy'. This not only retains critical name information for organizational purposes but also prevents potential issues with file name conflicts or invalid characters.  \n\nWe must now test the function 'save_normalized_audio_data' with actual data to validate its performance. While we believe the function should operate as expected based on its design, best practices dictate validation through testing. Your next step should be running these tests and reporting back with the results. \n\nThe to-do list for the project currently includes:\n\n1. Locate voice sample files in the Umineko/sound/voice/09 directory - (Completed)\n2. Write a function to handle different audio formats - (Completed)\n3. Extract the sample rate and data from each file using 'wave' or 'soundfile' library - (Completed)\n4. Normalize the data - (Completed)\n5. Save normalized audio data in an efficient manner - (In-progress)\n\nWith testing of the 'save_normalized_audio_data' function next on the list, please inform the team of the results when tests are complete. If the test is successful, task 5 can be marked as complete. If any issues arise, detailed feedback can help quickly diagnose the problem for a quick resolution."
