Content: This Python script (~read_audio_files.py) reads audio files from a specific directory, which is "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". The script uses libraries such as os, glob, and soundfile to open and read the audio files. A function 'read_audio_files' is defined that reads all the .wav files in the provided directory and for each file, the data and the sample rate is extracted.
