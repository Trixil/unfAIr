Content: Detailed Instructions for Adjusting Speech Speed:

Adjusting Speech Speed:
1. Locate the "Settings" or "Options" menu in the text to speech program's interface.
2. Look for a section specifically related to speech settings or preferences.
3. Within the speech settings, you should find a control or slider for adjusting the speech speed.
4. Use the control or slider to increase or decrease the speech speed according to your preference.
5. After setting the desired speech speed, save or apply the changes to ensure the new speed settings take effect.
6. Test the adjusted speech speed by converting text to speech and listening to the output.
7. Repeat the process if you need to fine-tune the speech speed further.

By following these steps, you can customize the speech speed in the text to speech program based on your preferences and listening comfort.

This addition provides detailed instructions on how users can adjust the speech speed in the text to speech program to enhance their experience.
