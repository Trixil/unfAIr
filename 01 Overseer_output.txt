01 Overseer: To-do:
1. Write a script that reads all the voice sample files located in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" directory. Open each file and store the text content of each file in a list. Save this list to a file called "voice_samples.txt" in the same directory. (COMPLETED)
2. Write a script that scans the specified directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and gets the list of all files in that directory. Save the file names in a list named "file_names_list". (IN PROGRESS)
3. Implement the functionality of scanning the specified directory for voice sample files and appending their paths to a list called `voice_files_list`. (COMPLETED)
4. Read the input text and convert it to speech using the character's voice.
5. Access the voice samples located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09.
6. Generate an audio file in an appropriate format (e.g., MP3, WAV) containing the speech output.
7. Save the audio file to a specified location.

01 Overseer: To-do:
- FileReader: Read all voice sample files located in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" directory and store their content in a list. Save the list to "voice_samples.txt".
- FileScanner: Scan the specified directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and get the list of all files in that directory. Save the file names in a list named "file_names_list".
- Speech Processing Role: Read the input text and convert it to speech using the character's voice. Access the voice samples in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". Generate an audio file with the speech output and save it to a specified location.
- FileLister: Fetch the list of file names in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and store them in a list variable called "file_list".
- File Management Role: Scan the directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and list all the voice sample files. Create a text file named "voice_samples.txt" and write the names of all the voice sample files in the directory, with each file name on a new line.

Current instruction for you:
