To-do:
1. Develop a script to access the directory C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 (In Progress).

Current instruction for you:
Please begin developing the script using Python. Use the os module to ensure the path exists before trying to access it. If the path does not exist, the code should return an appropriate error message. Likewise, if the directory exists but is empty, an error message should be returned. This code should also list all audio files in said directory.

1. Develop a script to access the directory C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 (Completed)

Current instruction for you:
The code you have written seems to correctly implement my requests and it appears to handle the possible error cases correctly. Let's move to the next step. If the directory exists and is not empty -- meaning it contains at least one .ogg file -- the code should return the absolute path of each .ogg file in a list format. Adjust the function to meet these requirements.
01 Overseer:
Current instruction for you:
You are requested to develop functionality to return the number of .ogg files present in the specified directory. Include it in the function you have developed earlier. Make sure to return None if the directory does not exist. You should update the 'access_directory_script.py' file with the new function.
01 Overseer:
The current to-do list is:

1. Enhance the script 'access_directory_script.py' with code to get the count of '.ogg' files (In progress)
2. Incorporate code to check if a directory exists and if it's not empty (In progress)

The code provided by LLM seems to align with the current instruction. It includes a function `get_ogg_file_count()` which takes a directory path as an argument and returns the count of '.ogg' files in that directory. The function correctly checks if the given directory exists with `os.path.exists()`. The ‘glob’ module is used to find all the pathnames matching '*.ogg' pattern given in the argument. Therefore, tasks 1&2 can be marked as completed. 

To-do:
1. Enhance the script 'access_directory_script.py' with code to get the count of '.ogg' files (Completed)
2. Incorporate code to check if a directory exists and if it's not empty (Completed)

The current instruction for you:
You’ve successfully created the function 'get_ogg_file_count', but the final paths and directories to be checked are yet to be confirmed. For now, hold off on executing the code.
