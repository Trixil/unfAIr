1. Locate voice sample files in the Umineko/sound/voice/09 directory - (Completed)
2. Write a function to handle different audio formats - (Completed)

4. Normalize the data - (Not started)
5. Store the data efficiently for later processing - (Not started)

Current instruction for you:
The code for gathering and loading different audio format files is ready. The next step would be to normalize the data. You will therefore need to write a function to normalize audio data. This function should take the audio data as input, normalize it (make all values between -1 and 1), and then return the normalized data. 

Once you have written this function, you can use it to normalize all of the data in the dictionary that was returned by the load_files() function. Store this normalized data in a new dictionary and return it. The keys for this new dictionary should be the same as the keys in the original dictionary (i.e., the file paths), and the values should be another dictionary. This second dictionary should have two keys: 'data' and 'rate'. The 'data' value should hold the normalized audio data, and the 'rate' value should hold the sample rate of the audio data, which can just be copied from the old dictionary. 

Please ensure your functions adequately cater for situations where the passed in file doesn't contain any data or other error conditions.

4. Normalize the data - (Completed)
5. Store the data efficiently for later processing - (Not started)

Current instruction for you:
The normalization of data has been successfully implemented. Now, the final step is to store this processed data efficiently for later use. Consequently, you will need to write a function to save this normalized data as a numpy binary file (a ".npy" file). This file will allow us to efficiently save and load this large amount of data.

This function should take the normalized data dictionary (the output of the normalize_all_files function) and a directory path as inputs, and it should save each dictionary entry into a separate ".npy" file. The name of each ".npy" file should be based on the original file path, but it should replace the path separators with underscores, remove the original file extension, and append ".npy" to the end.

Remember to include enough error handling to deal with potential issues like trying to save a file to a directory that doesn't exist. If an error occurs when trying to save one of the files, your function should print out an error message, but it should still continue to try to save the other files.

Note that numpy's save function can be used to save the data, and it automatically appends the ".npy" extension, so you don't need to add that manually.
01 Overseer:
Current instruction for you:
The function to save the normalized data is successfully implemented. Now, it's time to mark the last task as completed. Next, Glue together all the pieces of code from files 'audio_file_handler.py', 'audio_normalization.py', and 'save_normalized_audio.py' to show the entire flow of loading, normalizing, and saving the audio files. Please put all of this working code into one Python file named 'audio_manager.py'. Make sure the functions call each other correctly, and that the directory where the files are saved is "normalized_files". 
Ensure to import all necessary libraries at the top of the file and provide a safeguard if __name__ == "__main__": below the function definitions. Under this safeguard, please write a test script that confirms everything works together correctly, using a directory path of your choosing which contains some .wav, .mp3 and .ogg files. 

There is no need to provide output in this case, once you've prepared the Python file please simply share that on this thread.

Current instruction for you:
Proceed to create a function that would store voice sample data efficiently for later processing. Please note that different files should not overwrite each other's data. All data should be stored in such a way that it can be accessed later using the unique file path.
Store the data using numpy's ".npy" file format due to their smaller storage size and efficient retrieval. Create a new directory titled 'normalized_files' to store these numpy files.
To avoid complications, please ensure that all directory separators in the file path are replaced with underscores. 

For example:
If the file is originally in 'Umineko/sound/voice/09/FILE.ogg',
It should be stored in 'normalized_files' as 'Umineko_sound_voice_09_FILE.npy'.

Please remember to encapsulate this feature in a function named 'save_files' and add it in the 'save_normalized_audio.py' file.

For this task, there is no need to provide any output; just share the 'save_normalized_audio.py' file once the 'save_files' function is implemented as per the given guidelines.

Also, please update the user_documentation.txt file to reflect this new addition, clearly documenting the function's purpose, inputs, and outputs.

01 Overseer:
The code for storing the normalized audio data has been provided, but the task is not marked as completed yet. 

The code is written in such a way that each ".npy" file will contain normalized data from a single audio file. For every file in the format 'Umineko/sound/voice/09/voice_file.ogg', a corresponding numpy file named 'Umineko_sound_voice_09_voice_file.npy' will be saved in the 'normalized_files' directory.

Next, please test the 'save_normalized_audio_data' function with some actual data to ensure that the function works as expected. This test will help us confirm that the function correctly saves the provided data in the right directory and correctly formats the filenames for the ".npy" files.

If the test passes and everything is working as expected, we can mark task 5 as complete.

File name: save_normalized_audio_data.py
Syntax: 
1. save_normalized_audio_data(data_dict, directory='normalized_files'): 
    Input: data_dict - a dictionary where each key is a file path, and its corresponding value is another dictionary with two keys, 'data' and 'rate'. 'data' holds the audio data, and 'rate' holds the sample rate. 
           directory - directory path where ".npy" files will be saved (default is 'normalized_files').
    Output: None, but saves each dictionary entry into a separate ".npy" file in the given directory, with the original file path's directory separators replaced with underscores and the original file extension replaced with '.npy'.

Description: This module contains the function save_normalized_audio_data that takes a dictionary of normalized audio data and a directory path. It saves each audio data as a ".npy" file in the given directory, after replacing the directory separators in the file path with underscores, removing the original file extension, and appending '.npy'. If the directory does not exist, it creates one.

01 Overseer:
This is a Python-based software which processes audio files. It extracts data from various audio files located in the "Umineko/sound/voice/09" directory by normalizing and storing them for future processing. To ensure efficient retrieval and minimal storage size, the normalized audio data will be stored as ".npy" files.

Here is the plan for software creation broken down into tasks:

1. Locate the directory containing voice samples which need to be processed. 
2. Develop a function that can handle multiple audio formats. 
3. Extract valuable information from each file, which includes the sample rate and data. 
4. Normalize this data for effective processing.
5. Store this normalized data in an efficient manner for later processing.

Each task has a 'Completed' or 'In-progress' status attached to it. The status 'Completed' means that the task is done, and 'In-progress' means that it is currently being worked on.

Current progress of the tasks: 
1. Locate voice sample files in the Umineko/sound/voice/09 directory - (Completed)
2. Write a function to handle different audio formats - (Completed)
3. Extract sample rate and data from each file using "wave" or "soundfile" library - (Completed)
4. Normalize the data - (Completed)
5. Store the data efficiently for later processing - (In-progress)

Based on the progress of the tasks mentioned above, most of the key parts of the software have been accomplished. Now, 01 has to finish the last remaining task, which is to "Store the data efficiently for later processing". Post completion of this task, we can move on to the next phase of our project which will be determined by the project requirements.

Current instruction for you:
Now, you need to write a Python function to save the normalized audio data obtained from the audio files. Use numpy's ".npy" file format to store these data files due to their smaller size and fast I/O. Store each file's data in a separate ".npy" file wherein the file names should be identical to the original audio files but with the .npy extension. The function should also handle the scenario when the directory for storing the ".npy" files does not exist. In such a case, the function should be able to create a new directory.
01 Overseer:
We are making progress in our project of creating Python software for audio analysis. Currently, task 5 is underway. In this task, a function named 'save_normalized_audio_data' is being developed in the 'save_normalized_audio_data.py' file. This function is crucial for efficiently saving the normalized audio data into different numpy files, one for each original audio file. 

The choice to use numpy .npy files for data storage comes with benefits, including a smaller file size and the advantage of efficient retrieval. The directory where these .npy files are saved is flexible and can be specified by the user. If not specified, the default value set for the directory is 'normalized_files'. If the specified directory does not previously exist, the function will create it. 

The code logic provided is mindful of saving errors that can occur due to unacceptable characters in file names. For instance, directory separators are not good for file names. Therefore, original paths like 'Umineko/sound/voice/09/FILE.ogg' will be converted to something like this: 'Umineko_sound_voice_09_FILE.npy'. This way, the file name still maintains all the original path information, and we avoid any potential clashes due to removing character separators. 

The functionality of this new development needs to be verified through tests. We are positive that the save_normalized_audio_data function was well created and would operate as expected, and testing it would just provide more confirmation. 

Here is the 'save_normalized_audio_data.py' code: 
```python 
import numpy as np
import os

def save_normalized_audio_data(categorized_data_dict, save_dir='normalized_files'):
    # Create directory if not exists
    if not os.path.exists(save_dir):
        os.makedirs(save_dir)
    
    # Save each file's data in a separate ".npy" file
    for file_path, audio_data in categorized_data_dict.items():
        # Replace directory separators with underscores
        file_name = file_path.replace(os.path.sep, '_')
        np.save(f'{save_dir}/{file_name}.npy', audio_data['data'])
```
The to-do list remains as follows:
1. Locate voice sample files in the Umineko/sound/voice/09 directory - (Completed)
2. Write a function to handle different audio formats - (Completed)
3. Extract sample rate and data from each file using 'wave' or 'soundfile' library - (Completed)
4. Normalize the data - (Completed)
5. Efficiently store normalized audio data - (In-progress)

It is recommended that your next immediate step should be testing the save_normalized_audio_data function with some actual data to verify if it works as expected. Upon completion of the test, please inform the team of the results so we can take the next step. If it fails, be insightful in giving details for troubleshooting. If it passes the test, the task status will be updated to "Completed".
01 Overseer:
In order to further progress on our script for creating audio software in Python, the task of storing normalized audio data efficiently has been started. The function 'save_normalized_audio_data' has been implemented to take care of this process, which is outlined in the file 'save_normalized_audio_data.py'.

The function is designed to save the normalized audio data in a compact manner in numpy .npy files. The location of these stored files can be designated by the user through a directory argument; if not provided, the function defaults to the directory 'normalized_files'. Importantly, the function ensures file naming compatibility by replacing original file directory separators with underscores and removing the original file extension.

The provided logic appears sound and proper, transforming file paths like 'Umineko/sound/voice/09/FILE.ogg' into 'Umineko_sound_voice_09_FILE.npy'. This not only retains critical name information for organizational purposes but also prevents potential issues with file name conflicts or invalid characters.  

We must now test the function 'save_normalized_audio_data' with actual data to validate its performance. While we believe the function should operate as expected based on its design, best practices dictate validation through testing. Your next step should be running these tests and reporting back with the results. 

The to-do list for the project currently includes:

1. Locate voice sample files in the Umineko/sound/voice/09 directory - (Completed)
2. Write a function to handle different audio formats - (Completed)
3. Extract the sample rate and data from each file using 'wave' or 'soundfile' library - (Completed)
4. Normalize the data - (Completed)
5. Save normalized audio data in an efficient manner - (In-progress)

With testing of the 'save_normalized_audio_data' function next on the list, please inform the team of the results when tests are complete. If the test is successful, task 5 can be marked as complete. If any issues arise, detailed feedback can help quickly diagnose the problem for a quick resolution.
