1. Update the user_documentation.txt file with detailed instructions for new users (Not Started)
2. Implement a feature to adjust the speech speed based on user input (Not Started)

Current instruction for you: 

To adjust the speech speed based on user input, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the adjust_speed_feature.py file in your code editor.
2. Look for the function that handles the speech speed adjustment. This function typically contains code that adjusts the speed of the speech output.
3. Within this function, you can add logic to read user input for the desired speed adjustment. You can prompt the user to input a value or choose from predefined speed options.
4. Update the code to adjust the speech speed based on the user input. This may involve changing variables that control the speed, such as rate or tempo parameters.
5. Test the feature to ensure that the speech speed changes according to the user input.

If you need further assistance or clarification on any specific part of the code, feel free to ask!
