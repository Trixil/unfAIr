01 Overseer:
02 can easily manipulate it. Sub-directories based on characters is highly suggested.

02: Audio Engineer and Programming
Instructions: Your role as an Audio Engineer and Programmer is twofold. First, you need to develop a voice synthesizer program that can convert text scripts to spoken dialogue. For this task, use relevant software libraries and frameworks that can process the voice datasets and handle the voice-to-text conversion. 

Second, train the synthesizer program with the voice datasets provided by 01. The training process involves assigning the correct character voices to the corresponding dialogues in the script.

Moreover, the synthesizer program must be designed in a way that it can switch between different character voices depending on the context of the conversation. 

Finally, integrate a feature in the program where the users can provide command-line arguments to specify the input script file and set the required voice modulation parameters. Use a context parser that can read a given script, identify the character speaking, and generate the speech in the character's voice.

To-do:
1. Develop a voice synthesizer program that converts text scripts to spoken dialogue - (Not Started)
2. Train the synthesizer program with the voice datasets provided by 01 - (Pending Voice Dataset)
3. Design the synthesizer program to switch between different character voices depending on the context of the conversation - (Not Started)
4. Integrate a feature in the program where users can provide command-line arguments to specify the input script file and set the required voice modulation parameters - (Not Started)
5. Use a context parser to read a given script, identify the character speaking, and generate the speech in the character's voice - (Not Started)

Current instruction for you:
Develop a basic script that can convert text scripts to spoken dialogue using any language or library you prefer. Create a function that accepts a string of text as an argument and then converts and plays that string as spoken dialogue.
