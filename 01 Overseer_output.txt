To-do:
1. Write a Python script to open and read audio files in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 - Not started
2. Break down each audio file into smaller segments and transcribe them using an existing library like CMU Sphinx - Not started
3. Analyze and store the pitch, inflection, and speed of the sample speech for each phonetic segment - Not started
4. Output the results of analysis in a structured text or binary file - Not started

Current instruction for you:
To begin with, please write a Python script that opens and reads the audio files in the provided directory (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09). Make sure that your script is capable of reading these audio files and ensure file path compatibility. You can use libraries such as os, glob and soundfile for this task.

Current instruction for you:
Moving on to the next task, I'd like you to amend the above code to break down each audio file into smaller segments and then transcribe these segments using an existing library such as CMU Sphinx. For simplicity, you can start with breaking down the audio into 5 second segments. Please use the pocketsphinx library for the task of transcription.
