01 Overseer: To-do:
1. Use the `os` module to check if the given directory `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09` exists. (In progress)
2. If the directory exists, use the `os` module to list all the files in that directory. (Not started)
3. Filter the file list to only include files ending with the extension ".wav". (Not started)
4. Store the filtered file names in a list. (Not started)
5. Sort the list in alphabetical order. (Not started)
6. Store the sorted file names in a file named "voice_samples.txt" in the same directory. (Not started)
7. Read the content of each file using the `wave` module to get the audio duration in seconds. (Not started)
8. Store the file names and their corresponding audio durations in a dictionary named "file_durations". (Not started)

Current instruction for you:
1. Use the `os` module to check if the given directory `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09` exists.
