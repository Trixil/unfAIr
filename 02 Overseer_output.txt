Current instruction for 02:
Please create a script that reads the content of each file name in the "file_names_list" and appends the text content of each file to a list named "text_content_list". Return the final list as the output.

Completed: NO
02 Overseer: To-do:
1. Write a script that reads the "voice_samples.txt" file created by 01. For each line in the file, utilize a text-to-speech library of your choice to convert the text into speech with the assigned character's voice. Play the speech output to the user (Progress: NOT STARTED)
2. Write a script that reads the content of each file name in the "file_names_list". Append the text content of each file to a list named "text_content_list". Return the final list as the output (Progress: STARTED)
3. Implement the functionality of converting text to speech using the voice samples from the `voice_files_list` and pyttsx3 library. Play the generated speech. (Progress: NOT STARTED)
4. Develop a user interface for the text to speech program. (Progress: NOT STARTED)
5. Write a script that prompts the user to enter the text they want to convert into speech. Then, using the pyttsx3 library, convert the user's input into speech using the default voice and with a rate of 150. Save the output audio file as "output.wav" in the same directory as the script (Progress: NOT STARTED)

Current instruction for you:
Please complete the code in `file_reader_script.py` to read the content of each file name in the "file_names_list" and append the text content of each file to the `text_content_list`. Make sure to return the final list as the output.
