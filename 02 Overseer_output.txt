02 Overseer: To-do: 
1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Pending)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (pending)
3. Use statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo - (Pending)
4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01Åfs output - (Pending)
5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Pending)

Current instruction for you: 

Start by writing the basic shell of the text-to-speech algorithm using common available libraries. This shell should include methods for inputting text that will be converted into speech.

Current instruction for you: 

The basic text-to-speech functionality has been implemented. Now, implement a method within your script to alter the attributes of the speech audio such as pitch, frequency, and tempo. First, focus on adjusting the pitch of the speech generated from the input text. Make sure you create an object-oriented structure for future expansion of the program.

1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Completed)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (Ongoing: Pitch Completed)

5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Completed)

Current instruction for you: 

Great, pitch modification has been implemented successfully. Let's proceed to the next feature - frequency adjustment. Implement a method to adjust the frequency of the synthesized speech audio using the `pydub` library. Remember to maintain the object-oriented structure.

1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Completed)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (Ongoing: Pitch, Frequency Completed)

4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01Åfs output - (Pending)
5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Completed)

Current instruction for you:

Excellent! Now that we have the pitch and frequency adjustments in place, let's proceed with the adjustment of the tempo. Implement the function `alter_tempo` in a similar manner as previous ones. Utilize the pydub's `speedup` or `slowdown` function to adjust the tempo. You may have to adjust the factor appropriately to make sure the tempo speeds up or slows down as specified by the user. Remember to keep the implementation in the same object-oriented style.
02 Overseer: Code Review:

Everything seems to be in place as instructed. The 'alter_tempo' function has been implemented correctly. It receives a factor as input and adjusts the tempo of the speech by either speeding it up or slowing it down, depending on whether the factor given is positive (speed up the tempo) or negative (slow down the tempo).

To-do: 
1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Completed)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (Completed)
3. Use statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo - (Pending)
4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01Åfs output - (Pending)
5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Completed)

Current instruction for you:
Now that the 'alter_tempo' function is completed, let's proceed to task 3. Fetch the latest statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo. Also, prepare to integrate these statistics into the existing 'TextToSpeech' class as variables in the 'init' method. These values will then be utilized in the previously defined alter functions.
