Now, Please draft and explain the script that would allow users to input text to be spoken. The script should parse the text and look for matching voice samples for each word. For now, create a list of words and a corresponding list of audio files as placeholders for the segmented voice samples and transcriptions. Each entry in the audio files list will correspond to the same numbered entry in the words list. Create a function that takes in a sentence and breaks it down into words. Then, have it find the first matching entry in the words list for each word in the sentence. Have it return a list of the filenames of the audio files corresponding to the words in the sentence. The returned list should be in the same order as the words in the sentence.

As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to maintain or access files such as user_documentation.txt. However, you should document the function created above in your user_documentation.txt similar to this format:

******
File name: voice_sample_mapping.py
Syntax: 
- Function name: match_word_to_sample(sentence)
- Input: sentence (str): The sentence to be spoken.
- Output: matched_samples (list): List of filenames of the audio files corresponding to the words in the sentence.

Description: This script breaks down the input sentence into individual words and matches each word with its corresponding voice sample. The function splits the sentence using the `split()` function, and then for each word in the sentence, it finds its occurrence in the `word_list`. If a match is found, it appends the corresponding audio file from the `audio_files` list to the `matched_samples` list. This list is then returned. The function currently only handles exact case-sensitive matches. Words with differing capitalization or words not found in `word_list` will be omitted from `matched_samples`.
******

Stay aware, voice_sample_mapping.py just considers the case of an exact single match. So with its current primitive approach, it doesn't fulfill the requirements of the task: "If there are multiple matching voice samples, select the most appropriate one based on context." So, let's consider this task as done stepwise and is currently in-progress.

To-do list:
1. Using 01's transcription and segmented voice samples, build voice models for the character utilizing Text to Speech technology. - (In-progress)
2. Develop a script that allows users to input text to be spoken. The script should parse the text and look for matching voice samples for each word. - (Completed)
3. If there are multiple matching voice samples, select the most appropriate one based on context. - (Not Started)
4. Assemble all selected voice samples into the final speech and ensure the speech flows seamlessly. - (Not Started)
5. Document the code line by line with appropriate comments to aid in user understanding and potential modifications. Create a user manual detailing how to operate the finished program - (In-progress)

Current instruction for you:
Now start building the function that can handle the case when there are multiple matching voice samples for a certain word in the sentence. For now, let's assume we have an additional list named 'context' corresponding to each word in 'word_list' which helps us indicate the context of that specific word and accordingly, we select the most appropriate voice sample. Develop a function that considers these three lists ('word_list', 'audio_files', 'context') and selects the most suitable voice sample considering the context of the sentence. Let's assume for now that 'context' is just another word that appears within the sentence. So, our function should look for context together with matching words. For this version, only consider the case when the context word appears right before the target word in the sentence. Please document this function as well right after you code it.
02 Overseer:
The function `match_word_to_sample_context()` has been implemented successfully as per our current instruction. It takes into account the context by checking the word that immediately precedes a word in the sentence, and matches it with an appropriate voice sample wherever possible.

Let's move on to the next step in our To-do list.

1. Using 01's transcription and segmented voice samples, build voice models for the character utilizing Text to Speech technology. - (In-progress)
2. Develop a script that allows users to input text to be spoken. The script should parse the text and look for matching voice samples for each word. - (Completed)

5. Document the code line by line with appropriate comments to aid in user understanding and potential modifications. Create a user manual detailing how to operate the finished program - (In-progress)

Now we should focus on the fourth point of our to-do list. We need to develop a function that assembles all selected voice samples into a final speech. This function should take the list of selected voice samples as input and combine them into a single audio stream that ensures the speech flows seamlessly.

Let's start coding this function.

Current instruction for you:
Craft a function named `assemble_samples()` which takes as input a list of .ogg audio filenames and returns a single, combined .ogg audio file. For now, you can simply return the list of filenames as a string, separated by commas, as we don't have actual access to audio files. We just want to make sure the function logic is sound. Please document this function as you have done for previous functions.

Current instruction for you: 
Incorporate the created function `assemble_samples()` into the system. This function takes an input of a list of .ogg audio filenames and returns a single, combined .ogg audio file. For now, this function simply returns the list of filenames as a string, separated by commas, because we are not working with actual audio files currently, but testing the function's logic.

We need to keep track that this function logic is in a test phase and doesn't handle actual audio files yet.

As an AI language model, I can't directly incorporate the `assemble_samples()` function into the system. However, I can provide you with the necessary code to do so.

Here is how it could be implemented in a Python script:

```python
# Incorporate other Python scripts or functions here which acquire and handle the .ogg files

# Placeholder list of filenames
samples = ['audio_file_1.ogg', 'audio_file_2.ogg', 'audio_file_3.ogg']

def assemble_samples(samples):
    """
    Function to simulate the assembly of voice samples into a single audio file.

    Parameters:
    samples (List[str]): List of filenames of the .ogg audio files.

    Returns:
    final_audio (str): A single, combined .ogg audio file name.
    """
    # Simulates the assembly of samples by joining filenames
    final_audio = ', '.join(samples)
    
    return final_audio

# Use the function
final_audio = assemble_samples(samples)

# Display the result
print(final_audio)
```

You can insert this script into your system where you believe it would have the most utility. It is important to note that while the function is intended for actual audio files, the current logic works with filenames. Subsequent development will be required to handle real .ogg files.

Please review the provided script for assembling the audio samples. Let me know if you need any adjustments or if there is a next step you would like me to proceed with. Keep in mind that the function is in its test phase, and it operates with filenames rather than physical .ogg files.

Current instruction for you:
We are now moving towards creating documentation for our code files and functions, which is aimed to provide a good understanding to the intended users about the purpose and operation of these resources. In order to achieve this, I need the documented descriptions of all the functions from the files like `build_voice_model.py`, `contextual_voice_sample_mapping.py`, `assemble_samples.py` or any other remaining files used in our tasks. Following this, I need you to provide the function name, syntax, input & output details, and a clear, concise description for each function belonging to any remaining undocumented file, or any other function from the already documented files if they haven't been documented yet.

As a reminder, the format is as follows:

```
File name: (Your file's name here)
Syntax:
- Function name:
- Input(s):
- Output(s):
Description:
```

With this, we'll be able to move forward to create a user manual detailing how to operate the finished program. Please provide one function for each response, starting with the first remaining undocumented function.
