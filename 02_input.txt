Current instruction for 02:
Please create a script that reads the content of each file name in the "file_names_list" and appends the text content of each file to a list named "text_content_list". Return the final list as the output.

Completed: NO
02: To-do:
1. Develop a user interface for the text to speech program.
2. Provide a textbox where the user can input the desired text.
3. Implement a "Speak" button that triggers the text-to-speech conversion.
4. Display the generated audio file's download link or provide a built-in audio player for previewing the speech output.
5. Enable the user to choose the save location for the audio file.
6. Read the "voice_samples.txt" file generated by 01.
7. Iterate through each file name in the list.
8. Load the voice sample file using the file path provided and play it as speech.
9. Repeat step 8 for all the voice sample files in the list.
10. Write a script that reads the content of each file name in the "file_names_list". Append the text content of each file to a list named "text_content_list". Return the final list as the output.
11. Write a script that prompts the user to enter the text they want to convert into speech. Then, using the pyttsx3 library, convert the user's input into speech using the default voice and with a rate of 150. Save the output audio file as "output.wav" in the same directory as the script.
12. Implement the functionality of converting text to speech using the voice samples from the `voice_files_list` and pyttsx3 library. Play the generated speech.

Current instruction for you:
Continue working on implementing the text to speech functionality using the voice samples from the `voice_files_list` and the pyttsx3 library. Once completed, update the progress and provide the code.
