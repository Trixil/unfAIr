How to Use Text to Speech Program:

1. Inputting Text:
   - Open the text to speech program on your device.
   - You will see a text input box where you can type or paste the text you want to convert to speech.
   - Make sure to enter the text accurately without any errors.

2. Triggering Speech Conversion:
   - Once you have entered the desired text, look for the "Convert" or "Speak" button on the program's interface.
   - Click on the button to initiate the conversion process.
   - The program will start processing the text and converting it into speech.

3. Accessing Generated Speech Audio:
   - Upon successful conversion, you will be able to listen to the speech output.
   - The generated speech audio can typically be played directly within the program interface.
   - You may also have the option to download the speech audio file for future use.

Additional Features and Functionalities:
- Language Selection: Some text to speech programs allow users to choose the language and accent of the speech output.
- Speech Speed Control: Certain programs provide the flexibility to adjust the speed of the generated speech.
- Save or Export Options: Users may have the ability to save the speech audio as a file or export it to other platforms.

These instructions will help you effectively utilize the text to speech program. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the program's help section or contact technical support.

Excellent! Now that we have the pitch and frequency adjustments in place, let's proceed with the adjustment of the tempo. Implement the function `alter_tempo` in a similar manner as previous ones. Utilize the pydub's `speedup` or `slowdown` function to adjust the tempo. You may have to adjust the factor appropriately to make sure the tempo speeds up or slows down as specified by the user. Remember to keep the implementation in the same object-oriented style.

02: Code Review:

Everything seems to be in place as instructed. The 'alter_tempo' function has been implemented correctly. It receives a factor as input and adjusts the tempo of the speech by either speeding it up or slowing it down, depending on whether the factor given is positive (speed up the tempo) or negative (slow down the tempo).

To-do: 
1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Completed)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (Completed)
3. Use statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo - (Pending)
4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01fs output - (Pending)
5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Completed)

Current instruction for you:
Now that the 'alter_tempo' function is completed, let's proceed to task 3. Fetch the latest statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo. Also, prepare to integrate these statistics into the existing 'TextToSpeech' class as variables in the 'init' method. These values will then be utilized in the previously defined alter functions.
