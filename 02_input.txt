02: To-do:
1. Import the `gtts` module to convert text to speech. (In progress)
2. Create a function called `convert_text_to_speech` that takes two parameters: `text` (to be converted to speech) and `audio_path` (the path to save the generated audio file). (Not started)
3. Inside the function, initialize a `gtts.gTTS` object with the provided `text`. (Not started)
4. Save the speech generated by the `gtts.gTTS` object as an audio file at the specified `audio_path`. (Not started)
5. Test the `convert_text_to_speech` function by converting a sample text to speech and saving it to a file named "output.wav" in the current directory. (Not started)
