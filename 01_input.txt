To-do:
1. Navigate to the 'voice' directory at the specified pathway, "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and sort through all voice samples and categorize them by their underlying character's voice. (Not Started)
2. Use IBM Watson AI service or similar services to identify the different characteristics of each character's voice. The information should be stored in a dictionary with filenames for keys and characteristics like pitch, tone, accent, and speed as values. (Not Started)

Current instruction for you:
To begin with the first task, write a Python function that navigates to the specified pathway. This function should also open and read all voice sample files in the directory. Moreover, design the function in such a way that we can identify the underlying character's voice for each voice sample.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

Current instruction for you: 
The code currently retrieves a list of all the voice samples in the directory. To help identify the underlying character of each voice sample, we need to determine a method of differentiation. This might be based on the filename or on the audio sample itself. Please clarify the format of the voice sample files and how we might distinguish between different characters.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

Current instruction for you: 
You are asked to write a Python script to navigate to the 'voice' directory and retrieve the list of all the voice samples. However, we also need to distinguish each sample by their character's voice, so you have to provide more context about the nature of these audio files or the conventions used in their filenames to indicate different characters. Please elaborate on this matter. If there are no such indications in the filenames, we might need to assess the voice acting cast of Umineko to deducing which character is speaking in each audio sample.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

Please write a Python script which navigates to the 'voice' directory located at "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". This script should list all voice samples present in the directory. For now, you can ignore the problem of distinguishing between different characters' voices. Just focus on listing all available voice samples.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

File name: list_voice_samples.py
Syntax: list_files_voice_samples()
Description: This function, when called, navigates to the 'voice' directory at the path "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and lists all the files present in the directory, effectively listing all voice samples. The voice samples' list is then returned by the function.

Current instruction for you:

Please implement the list_files_voice_samples() function in the Python environment and run the function to determine if it correctly identifies and lists all the voice files in the directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". Remember to validate the output to ensure all files are returned correctly.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

Your task is to first navigate to the given directory, "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09", then use Python's os module to list out all .ogg files found within that directory.

Here is a possible implementation of that task:

```python
import os

def list_files_voice_samples():
    dir_path = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09"
    voice_samples = [f for f in os.listdir(dir_path) if f.endswith('.ogg')]
    return voice_samples
```

Please implement the list_files_voice_samples() function in the Python environment and run the function to determine if it correctly identifies and lists all the voice files in the directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". Remember to validate the output to ensure all files are returned correctly.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:
