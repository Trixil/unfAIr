01: To-do:
1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Not started)
2. Access the '09' directory (Not started)
3. Loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files in the directory (Not started)
4. Load the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram (Not started)
5. Clean and preprocess the audio files (Not started)
6. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
Please initialize by importing the necessary libraries with the following Python code:

```python
import os
import wave
```
Once you have written this, please respond with the code for verification.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

01: To-do:
1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Started)
2. Access the '09' directory (Not started)
3. Loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files in the directory (Not started)
4. Load the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram (Not started)
5. Clean and preprocess the audio files (Not started)
6. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
The code for the import of the necessary libraries is correct. Now, we need to access the directory '09'. Please write the Python code to access and list all `'.ogg'` files in the directory '09'. Use `os.listdir()` function for this. Respond with the code for verification.

01: The code you provided correctly lists all the 'ogg' files in the '09' directory.

To-do:
1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Completed)
2. Access the '09' directory (Completed)
3. Loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files in the directory (Not started)
4. Load the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram (Not started)
5. Clean and preprocess the audio files (Not started)
6. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
Now, we need to iterate over each '.ogg' file in the directory. Please add a loop in the provided script to iterate over the '.ogg' files listed in the '09' directory. As this point, we just need to print out the file name on each iteration. Respond with the updated code for verification.
