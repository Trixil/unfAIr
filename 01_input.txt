Current instruction for you:
Begin by importing the required libraries for deep learning and speech synthesis. We will primarily need TensorFlow for building the model, Librosa for loading and processing the audio files, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualizing the spectrograms and a few others. Implement the following code:

```python
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM, Bidirectional
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from scipy.signal import spectrogram
```

Current instruction for you:
Begin by importing the required libraries for deep learning and speech synthesis. We will primarily need TensorFlow for building the model, Librosa for loading and processing the audio files, NumPy for numerical operations also used by these libraries, and Matplotlib for visualizing the spectrograms. Implement the following Python code:

```python
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
```

Later, we may need some other libraries, such as Sklearn for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, but for now, these imports should be enough to get us started.

In terms of documentation.
File name: library_import.py
Syntax: No functions.
Description: This file imports the necessary libraries for developing a voice model using deep learning and speech synthesis. These include os and librosa for locating and loading voice samples, TensorFlow for building the model, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for visualizing the data. Additional libraries will be imported as needed in the subsequent steps of the process.
