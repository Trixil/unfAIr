How to Use Text to Speech Program:

1. Inputting Text:
   - Open the text to speech program on your device.
   - You will see a text input box where you can type or paste the text you want to convert to speech.
   - Make sure to enter the text accurately without any errors.

2. Triggering Speech Conversion:
   - Once you have entered the desired text, look for the "Convert" or "Speak" button on the program's interface.
   - Click on the button to initiate the conversion process.
   - The program will start processing the text and converting it into speech.

3. Accessing Generated Speech Audio:
   - Upon successful conversion, you will be able to listen to the speech output.
   - The generated speech audio can typically be played directly within the program interface.
   - You may also have the option to download the speech audio file for future use.

Additional Features and Functionalities:
- Language Selection: Some text to speech programs allow users to choose the language and accent of the speech output.
- Speech Speed Control: Certain programs provide the flexibility to adjust the speed of the generated speech.
- Save or Export Options: Users may have the ability to save the speech audio as a file or export it to other platforms.

These instructions will help you effectively utilize the text to speech program. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the program's help section or contact technical support.
File name: analyze_spectrogram.py
Content: The script ~analyze_spectrogram.py performs spectral analysis of voice samples, specifically to compute the spectrogram of a .wav file. It defines a function 'analyze_spectrogram' using the 'librosa' library to accomplish this task.

For the function 'analyze_spectrogram', the input is a file path of a .wav file. It executes the short-time Fourier transform (stft) of the signal and outputs the spectrogram. The script handles exceptions for scenarios such as non-existent files or non-.wav files.

File name: spectrogram_analysis.py
Content: The `spectrogram_analysis.py` contains the definition for the `analyze_spectrogram` function which performs the spectrogram analysis of .wav files using the librosa library. The function takes the path of a .wav file, computes the short-time Fourier transform of the audio data, and then generates a visual representation of the spectrogram using pyplot from the matplotlib library. Exception handling is included in the program to ensure that the file exists and is of the correct .wav format before processing. The function returns no value and directly displays the spectrogram for immediate visual insights.

3. Store all converted audio files in clearly labelled directories corresponding to the character's voice the samples represent - Not started.

Current instruction for you:
You are to create a script that reads the sound samples that we have converted and then stores them in specific directories based on the character's voice the samples represent. Ensure the directories are clearly labelled. Use the os and shutil libraries for directory manipulation. Assumption: the initial part of the filename indicates the character's voice, for instance a sample for character X would be named "X_something.wav". Check if a directory for this character exists, if not, create it. Then move the file to the respective directory.

Current instruction for you:
Please verify the code for the third instruction - creating a script to store all converted audio files in clearly labelled directories corresponding to the character's voice the samples represent - Awaiting verification.

Expected Behavior:
1. The script will change the current working directory to the provided directory path.
2. It extracts all files in the directory.
3. It iterates over each file:
   - It splits the file name using the '_' delimiter and retrieves the first part, which is assumed to represent the character's voice that the audio sample belongs to.
   - A directory path for the character is created.
   - If the directory for the character does not exist, the script creates it.
   - The audio file is moved into the respective character's folder.
4. Once all files have been sorted, it should print a success message.
   
Please validate each of these steps and confirm if they have been implemented correctly.

File name: convert_sound_samples.py
Content: 

The `convert_sound_samples.py` script is responsible for scanning through a specific directory (~C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09/) which contains voice samples, identifying the file format of each sample, and converting those that are not in .mp3 or .wav format. 

It does this by iterating through each file in the directory, checking the file's extension, and performing the conversion if necessary. The conversion is done using the PyDub library, which is a simple and effective library for audio file manipulation. If the conversion is successful, the original file is removed.

Exception handling has also been implemented to ensure that any conversion errors do not disrupt the entire process.

File name: sort_audio_files.py
Content: This Python script, ~sort_audio_files.py, reads all audio files from a specified directory and then sorts them into folders based on the character's name, which is represented in the initial part of each audio file's name. It uses the 'os' and 'shutil' libraries to accomplish this task. 

Initially, the script changes the current working directory to the user-provided directory. Then, it iterates through each file in the directory, retrieves the character's name from the file name, and creates a file path for a directory for the character. If a directory for the character does not already exist, it is created. Subsequently, the audio file is moved to the respective character's directory. The script completes its operation by returning a success message after sorting all the audio files.

How to Use Text to Speech Program:

1. Inputting Text:
   - Open the text to speech program on your device.
   - You will see a text input box where you can type or paste the text you want to convert to speech.
   - Make sure to enter the text accurately without any errors.

2. Triggering Speech Conversion:
   - Once you have entered the desired text, look for the "Convert" or "Speak" button on the program's interface.
   - Click on the button to initiate the conversion process.
   - The program will start processing the text and converting it into speech.

3. Accessing Generated Speech Audio:
   - Upon successful conversion, you will be able to listen to the speech output.
   - The generated speech audio can typically be played directly within the program interface.
   - You may also have the option to download the speech audio file for future use.

Additional Features and Functionalities:
- Language Selection: Some text to speech programs allow users to choose the language and accent of the speech output.
- Speech Speed Control: Certain programs provide the flexibility to adjust the speed of the generated speech.
- Save or Export Options: Users may have the ability to save the speech audio as a file or export it to other platforms.

These instructions will help you effectively utilize the text to speech program. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the program's help section or contact technical support.
File name: analyze_spectrogram.py
Content: The script ~analyze_spectrogram.py performs spectral analysis of voice samples, specifically to compute the spectrogram of a .wav file. It defines a function 'analyze_spectrogram' using the 'librosa' library to accomplish this task.

For the function 'analyze_spectrogram', the input is a file path of a .wav file. It executes the short-time Fourier transform (stft) of the signal and outputs the spectrogram. The script handles exceptions for scenarios such as non-existent files or non-.wav files.

File name: sort_audio_files.py
Content: This Python script, ~sort_audio_files.py, reads all audio files from a specified directory and then sorts them into folders based on the character's name, which is represented in the initial part of each audio file's name. It uses the 'os' and 'shutil' libraries to accomplish this task. 

Initially, the script changes the current working directory to the user-provided directory. Then, it iterates through each file in the directory, retrieves the character's name from the file name, and creates a file path for a directory for the character. If a directory for the character does not already exist, it is created. Subsequently, the audio file is moved to the respective character's directory. The script completes its operation by returning a success message after sorting all the audio files.

File name: convert_audio_format.py
Content: This is a Python script located at ~convert_audio_format.py. It is designed to convert audio file formats. It provides a function "convert_to_mp3" that converts audio files in WAV format to MP3, storing the converted files at a specified location. It also provides a function "convert_audio_files_in_dir" which iterates through all files in a given directory and converts any audio files that are not already in a specified target format. The target format can be any of the supported formats, which currently include only WAV and MP3. It uses the Python library "pydub" for processing audio formats, and "os" for file and directory handling.

File name: convert_sound_samples.py
Content: The script '~convert_sound_samples.py' utilizes the PyDub library to convert audio files located in a specific directory to .mp3 format, only if they're not already in .mp3 or .wav format. Successful conversions result in the removal of the original audio file. Any exceptions encountered in the process result in an error message being displayed to the console.

File name: analyze_convert_sound_samples.py
Content: The Python script located at ~analyze_convert_sound_samples.py uses the PyDub library to convert audio files in a specified directory to the .mp3 format if they are not already in .mp3 or .wav format. During the conversion: for each file in the directory it checks the file format and if not in the required format, it loads the audio file using PyDub, exports the file in the .mp3 format, and then removes the original file. If there is an exception in the conversion process, the script catches the exception,error message being displayed in the console.

File name: convert_sound_samples.py
Content: This file, found at ~convert_sound_samples.py, contains a python script intended for conversion of sound files located in a specific directory to .mp3 format if they're not already in .mp3 or .wav format. It makes use of the PyDub library for this task. In case of a problem during conversion, the script is designed to print an error message in the console and continue processing the next files. To complete the conversion, the original audio file is removed leaving behind the converted file.

File name: analyze_convert_sound_samples.py
Content: This Python script found at ~analyze_convert_sound_samples.py uses the PyDub library to examine and convert specific sound files in a given directory (~C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09/). During this process, it checks file types and, if they're not already in.mp3 or .wav format, it converts them to .mp3. Upon successful conversion, the original files are deleted and any conversion errors, if present, will be captured and logged.

File name: improved_convert_sound_samples.py
Content: The ~improved_convert_sound_samples.py script is an optimized version of the previously used `convert_sound_samples.py`. This Python script uses the pydub module to convert audio files in a given directory ('voice_samples_dir') from their current format to a specified format ('output_format'). 

The script now includes function input parameters to promote reusability. The 'voice_samples_dir' and 'output_format' are input parameters with predefined defaults. 

This script iterates over all files in the given directory, checks if a file is already in the target output format (default is .mp3), or is an .mp3 or .wav file. If these conditions meet, the script proceeds to convert the file to the target output format and removes the original file after successful conversion. 

In case the conversion process fails, the script tracks the files which encountered an error for future reference and continues with the remaining files in the directory. The function now gives feedback to the user about the conversion process by returning a boolean success flag and a list of files that encountered errors during the conversion.
