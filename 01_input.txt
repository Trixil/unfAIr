To-do: 
1. Write code to scan through the directory containing the voice samples - (Not started)
2. Extract necessary audio features from each audio file - (Not started)
3. Implement error handling for unsupported file formats and unreadable files - (Not started)
4. Save the extracted audio data in a parse-able format - (Not started)
5. Document each step and the extracted features of each file - (Not started)

Current instruction for you:
Let's start by writing the script that will allow your code to scan through the directory located at C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 and list all the files it contains. This script should be able to handle any exceptions or errors that might occur if it does not find the directory or if something else goes wrong. Remember to provide detailed comments explaining what part of your code is doing.
