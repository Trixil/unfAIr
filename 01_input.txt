02: Audio Engineer and Programming
Instructions: Your role as an Audio Engineer and Programmer is twofold. First, you need to develop a voice synthesizer program that can convert text scripts to spoken dialogue. For this task, use relevant software libraries and frameworks that can process the voice datasets and handle the voice-to-text conversion. 

Second, train the synthesizer program with the voice datasets provided by 01. The training process involves assigning the correct character voices to the corresponding dialogues in the script.

Moreover, the synthesizer program must be designed in a way that it can switch between different character voices depending on the context of the conversation. 

Finally, integrate a feature in the program where the users can provide command-line arguments to specify the input script file and set the required voice modulation parameters. Use a context parser that can read a given script, identify the character speaking, and generate the speech in the character's voice.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:
