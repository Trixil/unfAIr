01: To-do:
1. Write a script that reads all the voice sample files located in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" directory. Open each file and store the text content of each file in a list. Save this list to a file called "voice_samples.txt" in the same directory. (COMPLETED)
2. Write a script that scans the specified directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and gets the list of all files in that directory. Save the file names in a list named "file_names_list". (IN PROGRESS)
3. Implement the functionality of scanning the specified directory for voice sample files and appending their paths to a list called `voice_files_list`. (COMPLETED)
4. Read the input text and convert it to speech using the character's voice.
5. Access the voice samples located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09.
6. Generate an audio file in an appropriate format (e.g., MP3, WAV) containing the speech output.
7. Save the audio file to a specified location.
