01: To-do:
1. Access the voice samples in the assigned directory. (Not Started)
2. Convert these audio files into an easily parsed format. (Not Started)
3. Analyze the frequency, pitch, and tempo of the sound files. (Not Started)
4. Generate a statistics report on the pitch, frequency, and tempo variation of the voice samples. (Not Started)

Current instruction for you:
Begin by writing a script to open and read the files in the directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". Use python's "os" module to list all the files in the directory. After this, initiate the process of accessing the voice samples. You don't need to process the files yet, just access them.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

4. Generate a statistics report on the pitch, frequency, and tempo variation of the voice samples. (Not Started)

Current instruction for you:
Great! You have successfully accessed the voice samples. Now, write a Python function which uses the "soundfile" module to read the '.wav' files and convert them into numpy arrays for easy parsing. This is the beginning of task 2. Go ahead and implement that.

How to Use Text to Speech Program:

1. Inputting Text:
   - Open the text to speech program on your device.
   - You will see a text input box where you can type or paste the text you want to convert to speech.
   - Make sure to enter the text accurately without any errors.

2. Triggering Speech Conversion:
   - Once you have entered the desired text, look for the "Convert" or "Speak" button on the program's interface.
   - Click on the button to initiate the conversion process.
   - The program will start processing the text and converting it into speech.

3. Accessing Generated Speech Audio:
   - Upon successful conversion, you will be able to listen to the speech output.
   - The generated speech audio can typically be played directly within the program interface.
   - You may also have the option to download the speech audio file for future use.

Additional Features and Functionalities:
- Language Selection: Some text to speech programs allow users to choose the language and accent of the speech output.
- Speech Speed Control: Certain programs provide the flexibility to adjust the speed of the generated speech.
- Save or Export Options: Users may have the ability to save the speech audio as a file or export it to other platforms.

These instructions will help you effectively utilize the text to speech program. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the program's help section or contact technical support.


01: Current instruction for you:
Add a main function to the script that loops through all .wav files in a directory and uses the `wav_to_numpy` function to convert them into numpy arrays. The directory should be passed as a command-line argument. Save the numpy arrays in a separate directory also passed as a command-line argument.

Code:
```python
import os
import sys
import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf

def wav_to_numpy(filepath):
    '''
    Reads a .wav file and converts it to a numpy array
    Args: 
        filepath (str) - The path to the .wav file
    Returns:
        ndarray: numpy array with the content of the .wav file
    '''

    data, samplerate = sf.read(filepath)
    return data

def main(audio_dir, numpy_dir):
    '''
    Loops through .wav files in a directory and converts them to numpy arrays
    Args:
        audio_dir (str) - The directory that contains the .wav files
        numpy_dir (str) - The directory where the numpy arrays will be saved
    '''
    for filename in os.listdir(audio_dir):
        if filename.endswith(".wav"):
            data = wav_to_numpy(os.path.join(audio_dir, filename))
            np.save(os.path.join(numpy_dir, filename), data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```

To-do:
1. Access the voice samples in the assigned directory. (Completed)
2. Convert these audio files into an easily parsed format. (In Progress)
3. Analyze the frequency, pitch, and tempo of the sound files. (Not Started)
4. Generate a statistics report on the pitch, frequency, and tempo variation of the voice samples. (Not Started)

01: To-do:
1. Loop through all .wav files in a directory (Completed)
2. Convert .wav files into numpy arrays (Completed)
3. Save numpy arrays in a specified directory (Completed)

The current code provides a function `wav_to_numpy` to convert a .wav file into a numpy array. It also includes a `main` function that leverages `wav_to_numpy` to loop through all .wav files in a given directory, convert them into numpy arrays, and saves these arrays in a specified directory.

Current instruction for you:
Check the implementation of error handling. If a .wav file cannot be converted into a numpy array, the script should log an error message with the name of the problematic file and continue with the next one. Let's handle exceptions to ensure the program does not stop midway. 

Please create a function that handles the exceptions raised during the reading and conversion process in `wav_to_numpy` function. The function should return None when an error occurs and should print an error message along with the name of the problematic file. Afterwards, update the `main` function to ignore files returned as None by `wav_to_numpy` function and proceed to the next file.

Include the new function in the current Python file `convert_wav_to_numpy.py`. Provide the updated Python code once the implementation is done.

01: Current instruction for you:
Please check the `main` function implementation, specifically the line where the `.npy` file is saved. It seems there's a mistake in the variable name: `np.save(output_directory + '/' + file_name.replace('.wav', '.npy'), wav_array)`. The variable `wav_array` is not defined in the provided context. The correct variable should be `wav_data`, the one holding the result from `wav_to_numpy()`. Please amend this code and resend the corrected version.
