To-do:
1. Extract all voice samples from the given path C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. (Not started)
2. Transcribe all audio voice samples and timestamp each word. Pay careful attention to the distinct characteristics and frequency of the character's voice. (Not started)
3. Segment and label each unique sound at a word level to allow for voice duplication. Store these in an ordered format easy for parsing. (Not started)
4. Save the transcriptions and segmented words in separate CSV files in an easily accessible location, documenting each step of the process for future reference. (Not started)

Current instruction for you:
Start with the first task, extract all voice samples from the given path C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. Write a script that lists all the file names in the specified directory and outputs the total number of audio files extracted.Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:

Current instruction for you:
Please implement the following: consider any errors that might arise during the execution of the above script. Add appropriate error handling to ensure that the script execution doesn't break due to uncaught exceptions. Pay special attention to errors that might arise due to the absence of the directory, incorrect file format, or lack of permissions.

Once you have updated the script, please upload the updated version.

Current instruction for you:
Please implement a function that reads the audio files which we have extracted in the first task. The function should take in the path of an audio file, transcribe it, timestamp each word in the transcription and return the transcription along with the timestamps. Use the SpeechRecognition module to transcribe the audio. Note that for this task, we don't need to pay careful attention to the distinct characteristics and the frequency of the character's voice just yet, that'll be part of the following tasks.

Remember to handle exceptions that may arise when accessing and processing the audio file. Also, remember to keep the function general enough to handle any .ogg audio file.

Content: ile name: extract_voice_samples.py
Syntax: 
- Function name: extract_voice_samples(directory)
- Input: Directory path as a string.
- Output: A list containing voice sample file names and prints the total count of the audio files.

Description: This script locates all voice sample files in a given directory and counts the total number of audio sample files. It assumes the audio files are in .ogg format. This script will handle exceptions caused by invalid file paths, absence of .ogg files and issues with file permissions.

To-do:

1. Write a function that scans a directory and extracts voice sample files - (Completed)
2. Update the script to include exception handling mechanisms - (Completed)
3. Implement a function to transcribe and timestamp the extracted audio files - (Completed)

Current instruction for you:
Please confirm the completeness of all tasks assigned.

Based on the descriptions and code that you have provided, it appears that all of the tasks have been accomplished. The first function goes through a specific directory and extracts all the voice sample files. The script has been updated to include exception handling for potential errors during directory access. The second function then takes these voice files, transcribes them using Google's SpeechRecognition, and timestamps each word in the transcription. This function also includes exception handling for potential errors during file access. If no further adjustments are required, we can mark all tasks as completed and proceed.

If all tasks are indeed completed, please signal with a message saying "All tasks completed."
Contents of e: As instructed, I will now write a script containing the function to process the extracted voice files. The function will transcribe the audio file and timestamp each word. The SpeechRecognition module will be used for the transcription process. The function will also handle exceptions for file access issues. The output will primarily be a list of transcriptions with corresponding timestamps.

Description: This Python script locates and counts all voice sample files in a given directory. It is an updated form of the previous function with added exception handling features. The function specifically accounts for file errors such as non-existing directories or files, access permission issues, and unexpected errors. This function assumes the audio files are in .ogg format.
