01: Data Extraction and Sound Processing 
Instructions:  You are to locate and extract the sound samples from the specified directory (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09). As samples are found, write a script to convert these to a suitable format (such as WAV or MP3) if they are not already. Your script should store all converted audio files in clearly labelled directories corresponding to the character's voice the samples represent.

02: Text to Speech Processing
Instructions: Your responsibility is to build a text-to-speech processing engine that will translate the user's text inputs into synthesized vocal outputs. Create the scripts necessary for the text-to-speech process, make sure the script can categorize words into phonetic components and it should be able to make use of the voice samples from the voice directory in order to learn and mimic the particular character's voice.

Next Stage:
01 and 02 will have the scripts provided combined with executable instructions given to the user. The final product should be a script that uses the voice samples to produce the text to speech output in a specific character's voice. All scripts generated both by 01 and 02 will be reviewed for completeness, and then further instructions will be given if necessary.

Current instruction for you:
You are to create a script that reads the sound samples that we have converted and then stores them in specific directories based on the character's voice the samples represent. Ensure the directories are clearly labelled. Use the os and shutil libraries for directory manipulation. Assumption: the initial part of the filename indicates the character's voice, for instance a sample for character X would be named "X_something.wav". Check if a directory for this character exists, if not, create it. Then move the file to the respective directory.

File name: convert_sound_samples.py
Content: 

The `convert_sound_samples.py` script is responsible for scanning through a specific directory (~C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09/) which contains voice samples, identifying the file format of each sample, and converting those that are not in .mp3 or .wav format. 

It does this by iterating through each file in the directory, checking the file's extension, and performing the conversion if necessary. The conversion is done using the PyDub library, which is a simple and effective library for audio file manipulation. If the conversion is successful, the original file is removed.

Exception handling has also been implemented to ensure that any conversion errors do not disrupt the entire process.

01 Overseer:
Current instruction for you:
Please verify the code for the third instruction - creating a script to store all converted audio files in clearly labelled directories corresponding to the character's voice the samples represent - Awaiting verification.

Expected Behavior:
1. The script will change the current working directory to the provided directory path.
2. It extracts all files in the directory.
3. It iterates over each file:
   - It splits the file name using the '_' delimiter and retrieves the first part, which is assumed to represent the character's voice that the audio sample belongs to.
   - A directory path for the character is created.
   - If the directory for the character does not exist, the script creates it.
   - The audio file is moved into the respective character's folder.
4. Once all files have been sorted, it should print a success message.
   
Please validate each of these steps and confirm if they have been implemented correctly.

File name: sort_audio_files.py
Content: This Python script, ~sort_audio_files.py, reads all audio files from a specified directory and then sorts them into folders based on the character's name, which is represented in the initial part of each audio file's name. It uses the 'os' and 'shutil' libraries to accomplish this task. 

Initially, the script changes the current working directory to the user-provided directory. Then, it iterates through each file in the directory, retrieves the character's name from the file name, and creates a file path for a directory for the character. If a directory for the character does not already exist, it is created. Subsequently, the audio file is moved to the respective character's directory. The script completes its operation by returning a success message after sorting all the audio files.

In the above code, we are defining two functions. The `convert_to_mp3` function takes `wav_file_path` and `target_folder` as input and converts the WAV file to MP3. The `convert_audio_files_in_dir` function is looping through each file in the input directory. If the file is not already in the target format, it calls the `convert_to_mp3` function to convert. In the end, the function `convert_audio_files_in_dir` is called with a placeholder path.

Fetch: convert_sound_samples.py
Message: After analyzing the given 'convert_sound_samples.py' code, the code seems quite efficient already with necessary error handling to avoid crashes. However, a few potential improvements could make the function more reusable and user-friendly. Here are the proposed changes:

1. Function Input Parameters: The code has the directory hardcoded. Adding the directory as a function parameter would allow the function to be used for other directories as well.

2. Conversion Format Definition: Instead of automatically converting the files to mp3, we could add the conversion format as a parameter as well. The function could have a default value (for instance, an mp3) for the parameter in case it's not provided.

3. Return Value: The function could return a Boolean success flag and a list of files that encountered errors during conversion. This could be useful for users to deal with these problematic files.

These improvements may make the function more flexible and provide more feedback to the user about the conversion process. Now, let's implement these changes in the code.

File name: improved_convert_sound_samples.py
Content: The ~improved_convert_sound_samples.py script is an optimized version of the previously used `convert_sound_samples.py`. This Python script uses the pydub module to convert audio files in a given directory ('voice_samples_dir') from their current format to a specified format ('output_format'). 

The script now includes function input parameters to promote reusability. The 'voice_samples_dir' and 'output_format' are input parameters with predefined defaults. 

This script iterates over all files in the given directory, checks if a file is already in the target output format (default is .mp3), or is an .mp3 or .wav file. If these conditions meet, the script proceeds to convert the file to the target output format and removes the original file after successful conversion. 

In case the conversion process fails, the script tracks the files which encountered an error for future reference and continues with the remaining files in the directory. The function now gives feedback to the user about the conversion process by returning a boolean success flag and a list of files that encountered errors during the conversion.

Fetch: convert_sound_samples.py
Message: The 'convert_sound_samples.py' tries to convert every file in a fixed directory to .mp3 format if the file is not in .mp3 or .wav format. The file then needs editing. The conversion function should take the directory path and output format as input parameters and should return a list of files for which conversion failed if any. The directory path should not be hard-coded as it currently is. File name: convert_sound_samples_improved.py
Code:
```python
import os

    conversion_errors = []

    # Iterate through each file in the directory
    for filename in os.listdir(directory_path):

Current instruction for you:
The provided 'convert_sound_samples_improved.py' implements the desired changes correctly. It does not hardcode the directory path, takes directory path and output format as parameters, and correctly identifies and converts only the files not in .mp3 or .wav format to the desired output format. It also collects all errors during conversion and returns them at the end. You can mark these tasks as completed.

File name: convert_sound_samples_improved.py
Content: 

The Python script `~convert_sound_samples_improved.py` uses the PyDub library to convert all audio files within a user-specified directory to a desired audio format (input parameters). The script has been improved to make it more flexible (e.g., the directory path is not hard-coded anymore).

For every file in the specified directory, if the file is not already in .mp3 or .wav format, it attempts to convert the file to the desired format. After a successful conversion, the original file is automatically deleted to maintain space efficiency.

The script is smartly designed to handle any exceptions that may occur during the conversion process. If the conversion fails for any file, the script appends the filename to a list of errors. Finally, the function returns a message that either confirms the successful conversion of all files or lists the files for which the conversion process was unsuccessful.

File name: convert_sound_samples_improved.py
Content: This file (~convert_sound_samples_improved.py) includes an enhanced Python script that leverages the PyDub library for audio file conversion. Specifically, it alters any audio files in a user-defined directory not already in .mp3 or .wav format to a set desired format. Notably, removed are the hard-coded directory paths, increasing flexibility. After a successful conversion, the original file is immediately deleted. The script smartly handles exceptions during conversion, tracking them in a list of errors, and ultimately returns a message confirming success or conversely outlining any unsuccessful conversions.

File name: text_to_speech_engine.py
Content: This Python script (~text_to_speech_engine.py) is built for constructing the initial base for a text-to-speech engine. It imports the necessary libraries, initializes the engine, and sets up the properties like voice, speed, volume, etc. for the walkthrough. It contains a function `text_to_speech`, which converts the user's text input to speech. This function uses `engine.say()` to pass the text to the engine and `engine.runAndWait()` to block the method until the queued say() calls have completed the speech. At this stage, it's just a skeleton and will undergo more enhancements and additions later.
