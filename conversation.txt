01: Programmer Role
Instructions: First, you will need to write a script to access the directory that houses the voice samples. Develop a code to extract the audio files located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. You must make sure that the code takes into account all potential error cases, such as the path not existing or there being no files in the directory. 

02: Machine Learning Developer
Instructions: Once 01 has successfully written and tested a script that can extract the voice files, your role involves creating a Machine Learning model. Utilize the extracted voice files to input into the model. You should focus on generating a model that can convert the text into speech using the voice samples provided. Remember to put the program into a loop so it can continuously convert text to speech until the user terminates the program. Ensure you include comments in your code for clarity and easier understanding.

To-do:
1. Develop a script to access the directory C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 (In Progress).

Current instruction for you:
Please begin developing the script using Python. Use the os module to ensure the path exists before trying to access it. If the path does not exist, the code should return an appropriate error message. Likewise, if the directory exists but is empty, an error message should be returned. This code should also list all audio files in said directory.

Message: I am now starting the task. I'm going to write the code using Python. I'll use the os and glob modules, and the path to check is 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'. 
Code:
```python
import os, glob

def check_directory_and_list_files(path):
    if os.path.exists(path):
        if os.listdir(path): # if directory is not empty
            files = glob.glob(path+'/*.ogg') # list all .ogg files
            return files
        else:
            return 'Directory exists but is empty.'
    else:
        return 'Path does not exist.'

1. Develop a script to access the directory C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 (Completed)

Current instruction for you:
The code you have written seems to correctly implement my requests and it appears to handle the possible error cases correctly. Let's move to the next step. If the directory exists and is not empty -- meaning it contains at least one .ogg file -- the code should return the absolute path of each .ogg file in a list format. Adjust the function to meet these requirements.

01 Overseer:
Current instruction for you:
You are requested to develop functionality to return the number of .ogg files present in the specified directory. Include it in the function you have developed earlier. Make sure to return None if the directory does not exist. You should update the 'access_directory_script.py' file with the new function.

File name: access_directory_script.py
Syntax: get_ogg_files(directory_path: str) -> Union[List[str], None]
Description: The Python script (~access_directory_script.py) introduces a function 'get_ogg_files'. This function checks the existence of a specified directory. If the directory exists, it checks for files with the extension '.ogg', records their absolute paths, and returns a list of these paths. If the specified directory does not exist, it returns 'None'.

```
01 Overseer:
The current to-do list is:

1. Enhance the script 'access_directory_script.py' with code to get the count of '.ogg' files (In progress)
2. Incorporate code to check if a directory exists and if it's not empty (In progress)

The code provided by LLM seems to align with the current instruction. It includes a function `get_ogg_file_count()` which takes a directory path as an argument and returns the count of '.ogg' files in that directory. The function correctly checks if the given directory exists with `os.path.exists()`. The ‘glob’ module is used to find all the pathnames matching '*.ogg' pattern given in the argument. Therefore, tasks 1&2 can be marked as completed. 

To-do:
1. Enhance the script 'access_directory_script.py' with code to get the count of '.ogg' files (Completed)
2. Incorporate code to check if a directory exists and if it's not empty (Completed)

The current instruction for you:
You’ve successfully created the function 'get_ogg_file_count', but the final paths and directories to be checked are yet to be confirmed. For now, hold off on executing the code.
