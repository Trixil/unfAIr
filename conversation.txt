00: 01: Audio File Analysis and Processing
Instructions: Initialize by importing the necessary libraries. We will be using Python's os and wave libraries for file handling and audio file processing. Access the '09' directory where the voices are stored, loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files contained in the directory. Conduct audio analysis by loading the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram. Clean and preprocess the audio files by removing background noises and normalizing them. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' for easy access.

02: Text to Speech Model Training
Instructions: Initialize by importing the necessary Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries. We will be using Keras and TensorFlow in this case. Load the 'processed_spectrogram.npy' file generated by 01. Create and Train a Text to Speech model by feeding the processed spectrograms into the model. Implement Overfitting techniques and save the model, so that it can be used repeatedly. Lastly, write a function that can convert any written input into a sequence of sounds usable by our trained model.

End of iteration 1: Upon completion of these tasks, review the documentation generated by each LLM and determine the next steps (further tuning of the model, expanding the scope of the model to vary the characters' voices based on emotion, etc.) based on the results and performances between 01 and 02.

1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Not started)
2. Access the '09' directory (Not started)
3. Loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files in the directory (Not started)
4. Load the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram (Not started)
5. Clean and preprocess the audio files (Not started)
6. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
Please initialize by importing the necessary libraries with the following Python code:

```python
import os
import wave
```
Once you have written this, please respond with the code for verification.

1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Started)
2. Access the '09' directory (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
The code for the import of the necessary libraries is correct. Now, we need to access the directory '09'. Please write the Python code to access and list all `'.ogg'` files in the directory '09'. Use `os.listdir()` function for this. Respond with the code for verification.

01: Fetch: None
Message: As no specific file was mentioned for the changes, so I am going to write a new Python file named directory_access.py that contains code to access and list all .ogg files from the directory '09'.
Code:
```python
import os

def list_ogg_files(directory):
    # List all files in the directory
    files_in_directory = os.listdir(directory)
    
    # Filter out the '.ogg' files
    ogg_files = [file for file in files_in_directory if file.endswith('.ogg')]
    
    return ogg_files

# test the function
print(list_ogg_files('09'))
```
File name: directory_access.py
01 Overseer: The code you provided correctly lists all the 'ogg' files in the '09' directory.

To-do:
1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Completed)
2. Access the '09' directory (Completed)
3. Loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files in the directory (Not started)
4. Load the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram (Not started)
5. Clean and preprocess the audio files (Not started)
6. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
Now, we need to iterate over each '.ogg' file in the directory. Please add a loop in the provided script to iterate over the '.ogg' files listed in the '09' directory. As this point, we just need to print out the file name on each iteration. Respond with the updated code for verification.

File name: directory_access.py
Content: This file is located at ~directory_access.py. It contains a program written in Python to access and list all the '.ogg' files present in a certain directory. The function 'list_ogg_files' takes a directory path as argument and returns a list of all '.ogg' files present in it.

01: Fetch: example_script.py
Message: I will add a loop to iterate through the '.ogg' files in the '09' directory and print their names.
File name: ogg_file_iteration.py

for filename in os.listdir(directory):
