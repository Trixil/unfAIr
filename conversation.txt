How to Use Text to Speech Program:

1. Inputting Text:
   - Open the text to speech program on your device.
   - You will see a text input box where you can type or paste the text you want to convert to speech.
   - Make sure to enter the text accurately without any errors.

2. Triggering Speech Conversion:
   - Once you have entered the desired text, look for the "Convert" or "Speak" button on the program's interface.
   - Click on the button to initiate the conversion process.
   - The program will start processing the text and converting it into speech.

3. Accessing Generated Speech Audio:
   - Upon successful conversion, you will be able to listen to the speech output.
   - The generated speech audio can typically be played directly within the program interface.
   - You may also have the option to download the speech audio file for future use.

Additional Features and Functionalities:
- Language Selection: Some text to speech programs allow users to choose the language and accent of the speech output.
- Speech Speed Control: Certain programs provide the flexibility to adjust the speed of the generated speech.
- Save or Export Options: Users may have the ability to save the speech audio as a file or export it to other platforms.

These instructions will help you effectively utilize the text to speech program. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the program's help section or contact technical support.

File name: user_documentation.txt
Content: Detailed Instructions for Adjusting Speech Speed:

Adjusting Speech Speed:
1. Locate the "Settings" or "Options" menu in the text to speech program's interface.
2. Look for a section specifically related to speech settings or preferences.
3. Within the speech settings, you should find a control or slider for adjusting the speech speed.
4. Use the control or slider to increase or decrease the speech speed according to your preference.
5. After setting the desired speech speed, save or apply the changes to ensure the new speed settings take effect.
6. Test the adjusted speech speed by converting text to speech and listening to the output.
7. Repeat the process if you need to fine-tune the speech speed further.

By following these steps, you can customize the speech speed in the text to speech program based on your preferences and listening comfort.

This addition provides detailed instructions on how users can adjust the speech speed in the text to speech program to enhance their experience.

01 Overseer: To-do:
1. Update the user_documentation.txt file with detailed instructions for new users (Not Started)
2. Implement a feature to adjust the speech speed based on user input (Not Started)

Current instruction for you: 

To adjust the speech speed based on user input, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the adjust_speed_feature.py file in your code editor.
2. Look for the function that handles the speech speed adjustment. This function typically contains code that adjusts the speed of the speech output.
3. Within this function, you can add logic to read user input for the desired speed adjustment. You can prompt the user to input a value or choose from predefined speed options.
4. Update the code to adjust the speech speed based on the user input. This may involve changing variables that control the speed, such as rate or tempo parameters.
5. Test the feature to ensure that the speech speed changes according to the user input.

If you need further assistance or clarification on any specific part of the code, feel free to ask!
