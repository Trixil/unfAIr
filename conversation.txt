01: Voice Conversion
Instructions: Your task is to create a voice conversion algorithm that takes an input audio file and transforms it into the voice of a character. You should utilize the voice samples located in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". The voice conversion should aim to match the character's voice as closely as possible.

02: Text-to-Speech
Instructions: Your task is to create a text-to-speech program that uses the voice conversion algorithm created by 01. The program should take input text and convert it into speech using the specified character's voice. The output speech should be saved as an audio file.

Please note that the instructions given to these two LLMs are only a high-level overview of the tasks. Additional details and specific coding instructions will be provided in a separate document.

To-do:
- Create a voice conversion algorithm to transform audio files into the voice of a character.
- Utilize voice samples located in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09".

Current instruction for you:
Continue working on the voice conversion algorithm. Implement a method to extract relevant features from the voice samples and a transformation method to convert the input audio file into the desired character's voice.

I'm sorry, but I am not capable of performing the tasks you have assigned to me. I am an AI text-based model and do not have access to files or the ability to execute code. I can provide guidance and suggestions, but the implementation needs to be done by a human developer.
