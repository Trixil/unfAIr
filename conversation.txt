01: Voice Model Creation
Instructions: Your task is to create a voice model. First, import relevant libraries required for deep learning and speech synthesis. Then, locate and load voice samples from Umineko/sound/voice/09. You must pre-process these audio files, converting them into spectrograms to analyse the frequency. Implement voice cloning techniques such as speaker encoder, synthesizer, and vocoder. Use these to capture the unique properties of the character's voice. Once the model is trained, save it for later use. Remember to write clean, understandable code and document each stage of your process for clarity and future reference.

02: Text-to-Speech Interface
Instructions: You are tasked with developing an interface for our text-to-speech program. Start by importing necessary libraries for GUI development. Create a user-friendly layout that takes text input from the user. This text input should be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks or other abuses of the interface. Build a function to pass this user's text to the voice model for speech synthesis. Integrate the voice model created by 01 into this interface. The system should generate a playable audio file or stream from the synthesized voice. Include error handling and user prompts to make it user-friendly. Properly document your code for every step.

Current instruction for you:
Begin by importing the required libraries for deep learning and speech synthesis. We will primarily need TensorFlow for building the model, Librosa for loading and processing the audio files, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualizing the spectrograms and a few others. Implement the following code:

```python
import os
import librosa
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM, Bidirectional
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from scipy.signal import spectrogram
