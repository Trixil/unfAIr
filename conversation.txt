00: 01: Audio Parser
Instructions: 01's task is to access the voice samples in the assigned directory and convert them into a format that can be analyzed and manipulated. Write a script that opens and reads the files in the directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and converts these audio files into a file format that can be easily parsed and understood. After converting the files, create a script to analyze the frequency, pitch, and tempo of the sound files to be used in the creation of the text to speech program. Generate a statistics report on the pitch, frequency, and tempo variation of the voice samples.

02: Text-to-Speech Converter
Instructions: 02's task is to write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm. The script should allow for inputted text to be converted into speech and should provide options for altering the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech. This alteration should be based on the statistics provided by 01. After creating the text-to-speech converter, write a script that applies the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01Åfs output to the converter so that the speech produced resembles the characterÅfs voice from the voice samples. If necessary, use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries to help construct the base shell of the text-to-speech structure, but ensure the pitch, frequency, and tempo alterations are implemented correctly.

The current code provides a function `wav_to_numpy` to convert a .wav file into a numpy array. It also includes a `main` function that leverages `wav_to_numpy` to loop through all .wav files in a given directory, convert them into numpy arrays, and saves these arrays in a specified directory.

Current instruction for you:
Check the implementation of error handling. If a .wav file cannot be converted into a numpy array, the script should log an error message with the name of the problematic file and continue with the next one. Let's handle exceptions to ensure the program does not stop midway. 

Please create a function that handles the exceptions raised during the reading and conversion process in `wav_to_numpy` function. The function should return None when an error occurs and should print an error message along with the name of the problematic file. Afterwards, update the `main` function to ignore files returned as None by `wav_to_numpy` function and proceed to the next file.

Include the new function in the current Python file `convert_wav_to_numpy.py`. Provide the updated Python code once the implementation is done.

File name: convert_wav_to_numpy.py
Content: The Python script named convert_wav_to_numpy.py is found in the current directory. It includes functions to convert audio data from .wav files into numpy arrays. This conversion is useful for audio data processing, such as machine learning tasks. The conversion is facilitated by the function wav_to_numpy(file_path), which takes a single parameter, file_path, that specifies the path to a .wav file. The function reads data from the file, converts it into a numpy array, and returns the result. If errors occur during the conversion, the function will notify the user and return None. To convert multiple .wav files, located in a specified directory, the main(input_directory, output_directory) function is used. It automatically searches for .wav files in the input_directory, converts them into numpy arrays with the help of wav_to_numpy(), and stores the resulting arrays in the output_directory.

            # Remove transitions between segments

        # Alter frequency down by a percentage
        elif percentage < 0:
            self.sound = self.sound.slowdown(1-abs(percentage/100))

        file_handle = self.sound.export("altered_frequency_speech.wav", format="wav")
```
Please note that altering pitch and frequency risks introducing discontinuities between segments of sound. I used the `crossfade(0)` method to remove transitions between segments for the frequency alterations, giving each segment a sharp ending and beginning which may smooth out the audio. Return to me if any further adjustments are required.
02 Overseer: To-do: 
1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Completed)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (Ongoing: Pitch, Frequency Completed)
3. Use statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo - (Pending)
4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01Åfs output - (Pending)
5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Completed)

Current instruction for you:

Excellent! Now that we have the pitch and frequency adjustments in place, let's proceed with the adjustment of the tempo. Implement the function `alter_tempo` in a similar manner as previous ones. Utilize the pydub's `speedup` or `slowdown` function to adjust the tempo. You may have to adjust the factor appropriately to make sure the tempo speeds up or slows down as specified by the user. Remember to keep the implementation in the same object-oriented style.

File name: text_to_speech_alter_tempo.py
Content: This script has been added to the project to introduce the functionality to adjust the tempo of the synthesized speech. It uses the `pydub` library and maintains the object-oriented structure of the program. The `alter_tempo` function in particular alters the tempo (speed of speech) according to the user's input percentage value. The calculation of the new tempo relies on the `speedup` or `slowdown` functionality of the `pydub` library, allowing for a user-specified increase or decrease in tempo.

02: Fetch: text_to_speech.py
Message: The fetched code will be edited to add a tempo adjustment feature. The 'alter_tempo' function will be implemented, using the pydub's speedup and slowdown features based on the user's input. The updated code will be re-saved under the same name.

02 Overseer: Code Review:

Everything seems to be in place as instructed. The 'alter_tempo' function has been implemented correctly. It receives a factor as input and adjusts the tempo of the speech by either speeding it up or slowing it down, depending on whether the factor given is positive (speed up the tempo) or negative (slow down the tempo).

To-do: 
1. Write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm - (Completed)
2. Provide options in the script to alter the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech - (Completed)
3. Use statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo - (Pending)
4. Write an additional script applying the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01Åfs output - (Pending)
5. Use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries if needed - (Completed)

Current instruction for you:
Now that the 'alter_tempo' function is completed, let's proceed to task 3. Fetch the latest statistics provided by LLM 01 to alter pitch, frequency, and tempo. Also, prepare to integrate these statistics into the existing 'TextToSpeech' class as variables in the 'init' method. These values will then be utilized in the previously defined alter functions.

text_to_speech.py

This file houses the TextToSpeech class, which provides functions to convert text into speech and apply adjustments to the pitch and tempo of the resulting audio clip based on the user's input.

In particular:
- The `convert_text_to_speech` function takes in a text string, converts it into speech using the pyttsx3 library, and stores the resulting audio clip within a class-wide AudioSegment object.
- The `alter_pitch` function manipulates the pitch of the previously saved audio clip. Positive input values increase the pitch, while negative values decrease it.
- The `alter_tempo` function similarly changes the speed (or tempo) of the audio. Positive input values speed up the playback, while negative values slow it down.

Both `alter_pitch` and `alter_tempo` save the modified audio as "altered_speech.wav". The resulting audio can be accessed by checking the current directory of the script.
