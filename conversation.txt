Instructions: 
1. Read and process the files located in the directory C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. 
2. Identify the voice samples available in the directory and extract their file names.

02: Text to Speech Conversion Specialist
Instructions: 
1. Take the text input and convert it into audio using text-to-speech technology.
2. Use the extracted voice samples from 01 to represent the character's voice for the text input.
3. Save the generated audio as a playable file.

Note: As 01 and 02 cannot communicate with each other, ensure that 01 provides the necessary voice sample file names to 02 for accurate conversion.

Current instruction for you:
Please replace the value of the "directory" variable in the code with the correct directory path "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". Once you have done that, run the code and check if it correctly prints the file names of the files in the directory. If everything works as expected, please provide the updated code along with the file names printed.

Content: The `file_processing.py` script takes a directory path as input and iterates over all the files in that directory (including subdirectories). It extracts the file names and stores them in a list called `file_names`. Finally, it prints the list of file names.

Use this script to fetch the files located in a specific directory and extract their names for further processing or analysis.

File name: voice_samples.py
Content: This file contains code for identifying the voice samples available in a given directory and extracting their file names.

The main purpose of this code is to provide a list of file names for the voice samples in the specified directory. 
It uses the 'os' module to interact with the file system and the 'glob' module to search for voice sample files based on a specified pattern.

The list of file names is stored in the 'file_names' variable, where you can access it for further processing or analysis.

Please make sure to specify the correct directory path before running this code to get the desired file names.
