Message: As no specific file was mentioned for the changes, so I am going to write a new Python file named directory_access.py that contains code to access and list all .ogg files from the directory '09'.
Code:
```python
import os

def list_ogg_files(directory):
    # List all files in the directory
    files_in_directory = os.listdir(directory)
    
    # Filter out the '.ogg' files
    ogg_files = [file for file in files_in_directory if file.endswith('.ogg')]
    
    return ogg_files

# test the function
print(list_ogg_files('09'))
```
File name: directory_access.py
