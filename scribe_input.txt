Message: I have reviewed the existing user documentation. I will now provide detailed instructions on how to adjust the speech speed based on user input.
Code: None

File name: adjust_speed_feature.py
Code: 
```python
def adjust_speed(speed_level):
    if speed_level == "slow":
        print("Speech speed set to slow.")
        # Implement code to adjust speech speed to slow
    elif speed_level == "normal":
        print("Speech speed set to normal.")
        # Implement code to adjust speech speed to normal
    elif speed_level == "fast":
        print("Speech speed set to fast.")
        # Implement code to adjust speech speed to fast
    else:
        print("Invalid speed level. Please choose from 'slow', 'normal', or 'fast'.")

# Example usage:
# adjust_speed("fast")
```
