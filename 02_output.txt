How to Use Text to Speech Program:

1. Inputting Text:
   - Open the text to speech program on your device.
   - You will see a text input box where you can type or paste the text you want to convert to speech.
   - Make sure to enter the text accurately without any errors.

2. Triggering Speech Conversion:
   - Once you have entered the desired text, look for the "Convert" or "Speak" button on the program's interface.
   - Click on the button to initiate the conversion process.
   - The program will start processing the text and converting it into speech.

3. Accessing Generated Speech Audio:
   - Upon successful conversion, you will be able to listen to the speech output.
   - The generated speech audio can typically be played directly within the program interface.
   - You may also have the option to download the speech audio file for future use.

Additional Features and Functionalities:
- Language Selection: Some text to speech programs allow users to choose the language and accent of the speech output.
- Speech Speed Control: Certain programs provide the flexibility to adjust the speed of the generated speech.
- Save or Export Options: Users may have the ability to save the speech audio as a file or export it to other platforms.

These instructions will help you effectively utilize the text to speech program. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the program's help section or contact technical support.
