02: Fetch: voice_files_list
Code: 
```python
# text_to_speech.py

import pyttsx3

# List of voice samples
voice_files_list = ["voice1.wav", "voice2.wav", "voice3.wav"]

# Initialize the Text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Iterate through each voice sample file
for file in voice_files_list:
    # Set the voice sample file path
    file_path = "path/to/voice/samples/" + file
    
    # Set the voice sample as the current voice
    engine.setProperty("voice", file_path)
    
    # Speak the text
    engine.say("Hello, this is a voice sample.")
    
    # Save the spoken text as audio file
    engine.save_to_file("Hello, this is a voice sample.", "output_" + file)
    
    # Run the text-to-speech conversion
    engine.runAndWait()
```
In the above code, we utilize the pyttsx3 library to implement text-to-speech functionality. We iterate through each voice sample file in the provided `voice_files_list`, set it as the current voice, and then use the `engine.say()` method to convert the text into speech. Finally, we save the spoken text as an audio file using the `engine.save_to_file()` method.
