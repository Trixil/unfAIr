File name: reate a voice conversion algorithm to transform audio files into the voice of a character. (In Progress)
Content:  Create a voice conversion algorithm to transform audio files into the voice of a character. (In Progress)
- Utilize voice samples located in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". (Not Started)
- Maintain a documentation file user_documentation.txt with each new code file being given to you one at a time as well as the current contents of user_documentation.txt.

Current instruction for you:
Continue working on the voice conversion algorithm. Implement a method to extract relevant features from the voice samples and a transformation method to convert the input audio file into the desired character's voice.

Current documentation stored in user_documentation.txt:
No documentation written yet.
