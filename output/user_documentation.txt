Current instruction for you: 
You are asked to write a Python script to navigate to the 'voice' directory and retrieve the list of all the voice samples. However, we also need to distinguish each sample by their character's voice, so you have to provide more context about the nature of these audio files or the conventions used in their filenames to indicate different characters. Please elaborate on this matter. If there are no such indications in the filenames, we might need to assess the voice acting cast of Umineko to deducing which character is speaking in each audio sample.
