01 Overseer: Update the to-do list with each conversation with 01 and output it in your To-do field
01 Overseer: Message: I have written the code to import the necessary libraries.
Code:
```python
import os
import wave
```
File name: import_libraries.pyTo-do:
1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Not started)
2. Access the '09' directory (Not started)
3. Loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files in the directory (Not started)
4. Load the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram (Not started)
5. Clean and preprocess the audio files (Not started)
6. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
Please initialize by importing the necessary libraries with the following Python code:

```python
import os
import wave
```
Once you have written this, please respond with the code for verificatio
01 Overseer: Message: As no specific file was mentioned for the changes, so I am going to write a new Python file named directory_access.py that contains code to access and list all .ogg files from the directory '09'.
Code:
```python
import os

def list_ogg_files(directory):
    # List all files in the directory
    files_in_directory = os.listdir(directory)
    
    # Filter out the '.ogg' files
    ogg_files = [file for file in files_in_directory if file.endswith('.ogg')]
    
    return ogg_files

# test the function
print(list_ogg_files('09'))
```
File name: directory_access.pyTo-do:
1. Import necessary libraries - os and wave (Started)
2. Access the '09' directory (Not started)
3. Loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files in the directory (Not started)
4. Load the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram (Not started)
5. Clean and preprocess the audio files (Not started)
6. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' (Not started)

Current instruction for you: 
The code for the import of the necessary libraries is correct. Now, we need to access the directory '09'. Please write the Python code to access and list all `'.ogg'` files in the directory '09'. Use `os.listdir()` function for this. Respond with the code for verification
