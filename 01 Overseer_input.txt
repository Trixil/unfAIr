```To-do:
1. Access the specified directory: C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 - Status: Not started
2. Enumerate all audio files within this directory, recording their filenames and metadata for further processing - Status: Not started
3. For each audio file, apply an automatic speech recognition algorithm to transcribe the spoken text. Save the transcription paired with the filename - Status: Not started
4. Extract the raw audio data from the sound files, preprocess this data as necessary for the text to speech library to interpret it - Status: Not started
5. Save the preprocessed audio data and transcriptions in an easily readable format, such as .csv, for later use by the text to speech algorithm - Status: Not started
