Message: For the first task, I will write a Python script that uses the os module for directory traversal and file extraction. This script will traverse the designated directory and output a list of all the audio files found, as well as the total number.

File name: extract_voice_samples.py
Code: 
```python
import os

def extract_voice_samples(directory):
    # List all files in the given directory
    file_list = os.listdir(directory)
    
    # Filter list to only include .ogg files (assuming voice samples are in .ogg format)
    audio_files = [file for file in file_list if file.endswith('.ogg')]
    
    total_files = len(audio_files)
    
    # Print out total number of audio files
    print(f"Total number of audio files: {total_files}")
    
    # Return list of audio files
    return audio_files

# Replace the below directory with the actual directory path
directory = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'

extract_voice_samples(directory)
```To-do:
1. Extract all voice samples from the given path C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. (Not started)
2. Transcribe all audio voice samples and timestamp each word. Pay careful attention to the distinct characteristics and frequency of the character's voice. (Not started)
3. Segment and label each unique sound at a word level to allow for voice duplication. Store these in an ordered format easy for parsing. (Not started)
4. Save the transcriptions and segmented words in separate CSV files in an easily accessible location, documenting each step of the process for future reference. (Not started)

Message: The request requires the update of the provided script to include exception handling mechanisms. The exceptions to be handled include directory errors (like non-existence or permission errors), and file type checking to ensure the script looks for .ogg files only. I will write an updated version of this script that addresses these exceptions.
File name: extract_voice_samples_with_exceptions.py
Code: 
```python
import os

def extract_voice_samples(directory):
    audio_files = []
    total_files = 0
    
    try:
        # List all files in the given directory
        file_list = os.listdir(directory)
        
        # Filter list to only include .ogg files (assuming voice samples are in .ogg format)
        audio_files = [file for file in file_list if file.endswith('.ogg')]
        
        total_files = len(audio_files)
        
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The directory {directory} does not exist.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: You do not have permission to access the files in {directory}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}")
    
    # Print out total number of audio files
    print(f"Total number of audio files: {total_files}")
    
    # Return list of audio files
    return audio_files

# Replace the below directory with the actual directory path
directory = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'

extract_voice_samples(directory)
```
Update the directory with the actual directory path before running the script. In the case of an error, the script will print a message indicating the problem without breaking execution.To-do:
1. Extract all voice samples from the given path C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. (Started)
2. Transcribe all audio voice samples and timestamp each word. Pay careful attention to the distinct characteristics and frequency of the character's voice. (Not started)
3. Segment and label each unique sound at a word level to allow for voice duplication. Store these in an ordered format easy for parsing. (Not started)
4. Save the transcriptions and segmented words in separate CSV files in an easily accessible location, documenting each step of the process for future reference. (Not started)

Message: As instructed, I will now write a script containing the function to process the extracted voice files. The function will transcribe the audio file and timestamp each word. The SpeechRecognition module will be used for the transcription process. The function will also handle exceptions for file access issues. The output will primarily be a list of transcriptions with corresponding timestamps.

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

    r = sr.Recognizer()

    # Exception Handling for file access issues
