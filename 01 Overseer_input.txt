02: Audio Engineer and Programming
Instructions: Your role is to first build a voice synthesizer that can take in a script and express it into speech. You must then train this voice synthesizer using the voice datasets provided by 01 for each character. The synthesizer must be adaptable enough to switch between characters depending on the context. Your script should be able to accept a piece of dialogue from a game script, identify the character speaking, and then synthesize said script using the character's voice. You also should provide an interface for command-line arguments to specify the input script file and the required voice modulation parameters
