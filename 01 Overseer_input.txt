Message: I will write the requested Python script to access and read audio files from the specified directory. I will use os, glob, and soundfile libraries for the task.

File name: read_audio_files.py
Code: 
```python
import os
import glob
import soundfile as sf

def read_audio_files(directory):
    # os.path.join provided for file path compatibility
    directory_path = os.path.join(directory, '*.wav') 

    audio_files = glob.glob(directory_path)

    for audio_file in audio_files:
        data, samplerate = sf.read(audio_file)
        # Do something with data and samplerate

# Define the directory path
directory = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09"

# Call the function
read_audio_files(directory)
```To-do:
1. Write a Python script to open and read audio files in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 - Not started
2. Break down each audio file into smaller segments and transcribe them using an existing library like CMU Sphinx - Not started
3. Analyze and store the pitch, inflection, and speed of the sample speech for each phonetic segment - Not started
4. Output the results of analysis in a structured text or binary file - Not started
