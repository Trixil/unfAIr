Message: I am now starting the task. I'm going to write the code using Python. I'll use the os and glob modules, and the path to check is 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'. 
Code:
```python
import os, glob

def check_directory_and_list_files(path):
    if os.path.exists(path):
        if os.listdir(path): # if directory is not empty
            files = glob.glob(path+'/*.ogg') # list all .ogg files
            return files
        else:
            return 'Directory exists but is empty.'
    else:
        return 'Path does not exist.'

path = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'
check_directory_and_list_files(path)

1. Develop a script to access the directory C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09 (In Progress).

Message: Understood. As part of the next step, I will update the function to scan the directory and return the absolute path of each .ogg file in a list format.
File name: access_directory_script.py
Code: 
```python
import os

def get_ogg_files(directory_path):
    """
    Check if a directory exists and if any .ogg files are present in the directory.
    If there are .ogg files, the function returns a list of their absolute paths.
    """
    # Check if the directory exists.
    if not os.path.exists(directory_path):
        return None
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the .ogg files.
    ogg_files = []
    
    # Loop through every file in the directory.
    for file in os.listdir(directory_path):
        # Check if the file ends with .ogg.
        if file.endswith('.ogg'):
            # If it does, get the absolute path of the file and append it to the ogg_files list.
            ogg_files.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(directory_path, file)))
            
    # Return the list of .ogg files.
    return ogg_files

Message: I'll enhance the functionality of the previous script and embed the code to return the count of '.ogg' files present in a directory in case the provided directory exists and isn't empty. 
File name: updated_access_directory_script.py
Code: 
```python
import os
import glob

def get_ogg_file_count(directory_path):
    if os.path.exists(directory_path): 
        ogg_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory_path, "*.ogg"))
        return len(ogg_files)

    return None

print(get_ogg_file_count('C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09'))  # replace with the actual directory path
```

Message: I understand the responsibilities. I'll fetch files for reading, make modifications where necessary and ensure to furnish every response with the 'Fetch', 'Message', 'File name', and 'Code' details in the given order. No code execution will be performed and all written code would be given a descriptive file name. The usage of filenames not specified in the conversation will be avoided.

```The current to-do list is:

1. Enhance the script 'access_directory_script.py' with code to get the count of '.ogg' files (In progress)
2. Incorporate code to check if a directory exists and if it's not empty (In progress)

The code provided by LLM seems to align with the current instruction. It includes a function `get_ogg_file_count()` which takes a directory path as an argument and returns the count of '.ogg' files in that directory. The function correctly checks if the given directory exists with `os.path.exists()`. The ‘glob’ module is used to find all the pathnames matching '*.ogg' pattern given in the argument. Therefore, tasks 1&2 can be marked as completed. 

To-do:
1. Enhance the script 'access_directory_script.py' with code to get the count of '.ogg' files (Completed)
2. Incorporate code to check if a directory exists and if it's not empty (Completed)

The current instruction for you:
You’ve successfully created the function 'get_ogg_file_count', but the final paths and directories to be checked are yet to be confirmed. For now, hold off on executing the code.
