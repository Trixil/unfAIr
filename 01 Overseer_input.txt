02: Voice Modelling and Text-to-Speech Synthesis Developer
Instructions: Your role begins after 01's. Utilise the data parsed by 01 and try to create a voice model that best mimics the character's voice. Your code should learn from the information provided by 01 to create a model for the desired character's voice. Once the model is ready, apply it to a text-to-speech synthesis program's output. The resultant speech should bear a resemblance to the character's voice in terms of tone, pitch, volume, speed etc. Be sure to handle edge cases and test your code extensively with different sentences to ensure the synthesized voice is as close as possible to the actual character's voice. Document your method, the design of your model, and how well it handles different cases. Provide extensive code comments as well
