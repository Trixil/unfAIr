Voice Model Creation
Instructions: Your task is to create a voice model. First, import relevant libraries required for deep learning and speech synthesis. Then, locate and load voice samples from Umineko/sound/voice/09. You must pre-process these audio files, converting them into spectrograms to analyse the frequency. Implement voice cloning techniques such as speaker encoder, synthesizer, and vocoder. Use these to capture the unique properties of the character's voice. Once the model is trained, save it for later use. Remember to write clean, understandable code and document each stage of your process for clarity and future reference.

Syntax: No functions.
Description: This file imports the necessary libraries for developing a voice model using deep learning and speech synthesis. These include os and librosa for locating and loading voice samples, TensorFlow for building the model, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib for visualizing the data. Additional libraries will be imported as needed in the subsequent steps of the process.
