01: Voice Data Gatherer
Instructions: 01, you are instructed to locate the voice samples needed to train our voice model. This will involve navigating to the directory Umineko/sound/voice/09 and extracting all the files contained within. As our program needs to be able to handle various file formats, please write a function that can handle different audio formats. For each file, we should extract the sample rate and the data by using a library like "wave" or "soundfile". Ensure that all data is normalized and stored efficiently for later processing.

02: Voice Model Engineer
Instructions: 02, your task is to create an artificial intelligence model that can mimic the characteristics of a human voice. You have to use the preprocessed data provided by 01. Consider utilizing a pre-established artificial intelligence structure like WaveNet or Tacotron, or any other model that may provide the needed output. After the model has been trained, implement a function that allows the user to input text that the model will then convert into data compatible with the model, generating an output voice clip in the style of the trained voice. Test this function with varying types and lengths of text to ensure there is no apparent loss in quality or continuity. Lastly, encapsulate all the codes into a user-friendly script.
