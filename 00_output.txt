01: Digital Signal Processing, Voice Sampling & Analysis
Instructions: Your task revolves around the creation of a voice sampling module. Start by writing a Python script that can process all of the character's voice files located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. Your code should be able to:

1. Open and read the audio files in the provided folder.
2. Break down each audio file into smaller segments and assign a phonetic transcription to each segment using an existing library (like CMU Sphinx).
3. Analyze and store the pitch, inflection, and speed of the sample speech for each phonetic segment.
4. Output the results of your analysis in a structured text or binary file (such as CSV, JSON, or Pickle) for easy retrieval and use by 02.

02: Text to Speech Synthesis
Instructions: Your role involves creating a text to speech module that can synthesize speech in the character's voice. Write a Python script that:

1. Takes input text from the user.
2. Breaks down the user text into phonetic segments using a library such as CMU Sphinx or NLTK.
3. Matches each phonetic segment from the user's text to the closest matching segment in 01's analysis file.
4. Pieces together the appropriate voice samples to create a full speech snippet in the character's voice and style.
5. Outputs the resulting synthesized speech to an audio file, maintaining the correct timing, pitch, and inflection as much as possible.

Please note that without a specific AI or Machine Learning model tasked to learn the nuances of the character's voice, results may vary and may not completely mimic the character's voice.
