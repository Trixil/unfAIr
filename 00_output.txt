01: Voice Conversion
Instructions: Your task is to create a voice conversion algorithm that takes an input audio file and transforms it into the voice of a character. You should utilize the voice samples located in "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". The voice conversion should aim to match the character's voice as closely as possible.

02: Text-to-Speech
Instructions: Your task is to create a text-to-speech program that uses the voice conversion algorithm created by 01. The program should take input text and convert it into speech using the specified character's voice. The output speech should be saved as an audio file.

Please note that the instructions given to these two LLMs are only a high-level overview of the tasks. Additional details and specific coding instructions will be provided in a separate document.
