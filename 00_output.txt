00: 01: Audio Parser
Instructions: 01's task is to access the voice samples in the assigned directory and convert them into a format that can be analyzed and manipulated. Write a script that opens and reads the files in the directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and converts these audio files into a file format that can be easily parsed and understood. After converting the files, create a script to analyze the frequency, pitch, and tempo of the sound files to be used in the creation of the text to speech program. Generate a statistics report on the pitch, frequency, and tempo variation of the voice samples.

02: Text-to-Speech Converter
Instructions: 02's task is to write a script that implements a text-to-speech algorithm. The script should allow for inputted text to be converted into speech and should provide options for altering the pitch, frequency, and tempo of the resulting speech. This alteration should be based on the statistics provided by 01. After creating the text-to-speech converter, write a script that applies the analyzed pitch, frequency, and tempo from 01Åfs output to the converter so that the speech produced resembles the characterÅfs voice from the voice samples. If necessary, use existing character-based text-to-speech libraries to help construct the base shell of the text-to-speech structure, but ensure the pitch, frequency, and tempo alterations are implemented correctly.
