00: 01: Sample Extraction and Pre-processing Module
Instructions: 
1. Access the specified directory: C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09.
2. Enumerate all audio files within this directory, recording their filenames and metadata for further processing.
3. For each audio file, apply an automatic speech recognition algorithm to transcribe the spoken text. Save the transcription paired with the filename.
4. Extract the raw audio data from the sound files, preprocess this data as necessary for the text to speech library to interpret it.
5. Save the preprocessed audio data and transcriptions in an easily readable format, such as .csv, for later use by the text to speech algorithm.

02: Text to Speech Synthesis and Character Modeling
Instructions: 
1. Use the preprocessed data provided by 01 to build a character voice model. This task involves using machine learning libraries to analyze the audio data and establish patterns in speech, intonation, cadence, etc.
2. Implement the character voice model into a text to speech synthesis algorithm. Test the algorithm to ensure that it adequately reproduces the character's voice from the samples.
3. Write a functional interface for users to input text that they wish to convert to speech. Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to use.
4. Integrate the text to speech algorithm and the user interface so that the text input by the user is articulated in the character's voice as closely as possible.
5. Create clear and concise documentation detailing the functionality of the program and instructions for its use.
6. Package the software into an executable file for ease of distribution and installation.
