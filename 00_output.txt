01: Audio File Parser
Instructions: Your job involves working with the directory containing the voice samples. Your code should accordingly scan through all the voice samples located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. For each audio file found, your code should extract the necessary audio features such as pitch, tone, volume, speed etc. Ensure to implement error handling for unsupported file formats and unreadable files. Save your extracted data in an easy to parse format for 02 to use, and document the process and which features were extracted from each file. Provide detailed code comments.

02: Voice Modelling and Text-to-Speech Synthesis Developer
Instructions: Your role begins after 01's. Utilise the data parsed by 01 and try to create a voice model that best mimics the character's voice. Your code should learn from the information provided by 01 to create a model for the desired character's voice. Once the model is ready, apply it to a text-to-speech synthesis program's output. The resultant speech should bear a resemblance to the character's voice in terms of tone, pitch, volume, speed etc. Be sure to handle edge cases and test your code extensively with different sentences to ensure the synthesized voice is as close as possible to the actual character's voice. Document your method, the design of your model, and how well it handles different cases. Provide extensive code comments as well.
