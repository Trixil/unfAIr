Please note that I have divided the roles based on the responsibilities in accomplishing the task but feel free to adjust them or add more roles if necessary.
00: 01: FileLister
Instructions: Write a script that fetches the list of file names present in the directory "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09" and store them in a list variable called "file_list".

02: TextToSpeechConverter
Instructions: Write a script that prompts the user to enter the text they want to convert into speech. Then, using the pyttsx3 library, convert the user's input into speech using the default voice and with a rate of 150. Save the output audio file as "output.wav" in the same directory as the script.
