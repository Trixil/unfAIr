00: 01: File Manipulation

Instructions:
1. Use the `os` module to check if the given directory `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09` exists.
2. If the directory exists, use the `os` module to list all the files in that directory.
3. Filter the file list to only include files ending with the extension ".wav".
4. Store the filtered file names in a list.
5. Sort the list in alphabetical order.
6. Store the sorted file names in a file named "voice_samples.txt" in the same directory.
7. Read the content of each file using the `wave` module to get the audio duration in seconds.
8. Store the file names and their corresponding audio durations in a dictionary named "file_durations".

02: Text to Speech Conversion

Instructions:
1. Import the `gtts` module to convert text to speech.
2. Create a function called `convert_text_to_speech` that takes two parameters: `text` (to be converted to speech) and `audio_path` (the path to save the generated audio file).
3. Inside the function, initialize a `gtts.gTTS` object with the provided `text`.
4. Save the speech generated by the `gtts.gTTS` object as an audio file at the specified `audio_path`.
5. Test the `convert_text_to_speech` function by converting a sample text to speech and saving it to a file named "output.wav" in the current directory.
