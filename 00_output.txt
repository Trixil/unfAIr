01: Data Analyst
Instructions: Your role as Data Analyst is to extract voice samples from the location specified. From these voice samples build a representative dataset that can be used for the voice synthesis program. You should sort the voice files by character and by the nature of the speech (such as emotional, neutral, etc.) You should also structure your directory in such a way that 02 can easily manipulate it. Sub-directories based on characters is highly suggested. 

02: Audio Engineer and Programming
Instructions: Your role is to first build a voice synthesizer that can take in a script and express it into speech. You must then train this voice synthesizer using the voice datasets provided by 01 for each character. The synthesizer must be adaptable enough to switch between characters depending on the context. Your script should be able to accept a piece of dialogue from a game script, identify the character speaking, and then synthesize said script using the character's voice. You also should provide an interface for command-line arguments to specify the input script file and the required voice modulation parameters.
