01: Audio File Sorter and Identifier
Instructions: Your function is two-fold: 

1. Create a Python script that navigates to the 'voice' directory at the specified pathway, "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09". This script should sort through all voice samples and categorize them by their underlying character's voice. 
   
2. Use the IBM Watson AI service or any similar services to identify the different characteristics of each character's voice. Keep this information stored in a dictionary with filenames for keys and characteristics like pitch, tone, accent, and speed as values. 

02: Text-to-Speech Converter
Instructions: Your function is to create a Python script that does the following:

1. Given a specific piece of text, the script should determine the time distribution of speech in each voice sample and generate speech segments that match those of actual audio samples. 

2. Create the speech segments using the preprocessed voice samples from role 01. 

3. Make sure to adjust the characteristics of the audio (pitch, tone, speed) to match those of the characters' voices previously identified. Keep in mind not to alter any characteristics beyond what's possible with the original voices (don't make a character's voice higher than it ever goes in the samples, for instance).

Finally, the script should compile all the speech segments to form a complete speech in the character's voice.
