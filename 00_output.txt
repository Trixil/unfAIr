00: 01: Audio File Analysis and Processing
Instructions: Initialize by importing the necessary libraries. We will be using Python's os and wave libraries for file handling and audio file processing. Access the '09' directory where the voices are stored, loop through all the Åe.oggÅf files contained in the directory. Conduct audio analysis by loading the ogg files and convert them into a spectrogram. Clean and preprocess the audio files by removing background noises and normalizing them. Save the spectrogram as 'processed_spectrogram.npy' for easy access.

02: Text to Speech Model Training
Instructions: Initialize by importing the necessary Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries. We will be using Keras and TensorFlow in this case. Load the 'processed_spectrogram.npy' file generated by 01. Create and Train a Text to Speech model by feeding the processed spectrograms into the model. Implement Overfitting techniques and save the model, so that it can be used repeatedly. Lastly, write a function that can convert any written input into a sequence of sounds usable by our trained model.

End of iteration 1: Upon completion of these tasks, review the documentation generated by each LLM and determine the next steps (further tuning of the model, expanding the scope of the model to vary the characters' voices based on emotion, etc.) based on the results and performances between 01 and 02.
