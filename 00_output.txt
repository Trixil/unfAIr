01: Programmer Role
Instructions: First, you will need to write a script to access the directory that houses the voice samples. Develop a code to extract the audio files located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09. You must make sure that the code takes into account all potential error cases, such as the path not existing or there being no files in the directory. 

02: Machine Learning Developer
Instructions: Once 01 has successfully written and tested a script that can extract the voice files, your role involves creating a Machine Learning model. Utilize the extracted voice files to input into the model. You should focus on generating a model that can convert the text into speech using the voice samples provided. Remember to put the program into a loop so it can continuously convert text to speech until the user terminates the program. Ensure you include comments in your code for clarity and easier understanding.
