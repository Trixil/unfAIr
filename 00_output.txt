01: Data Extraction and Sound Processing 
Instructions:  You are to locate and extract the sound samples from the specified directory (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Umineko/sound/voice/09). As samples are found, write a script to convert these to a suitable format (such as WAV or MP3) if they are not already. Your script should store all converted audio files in clearly labelled directories corresponding to the character's voice the samples represent.

02: Text to Speech Processing
Instructions: Your responsibility is to build a text-to-speech processing engine that will translate the user's text inputs into synthesized vocal outputs. Create the scripts necessary for the text-to-speech process, make sure the script can categorize words into phonetic components and it should be able to make use of the voice samples from the voice directory in order to learn and mimic the particular character's voice.

Next Stage:
01 and 02 will have the scripts provided combined with executable instructions given to the user. The final product should be a script that uses the voice samples to produce the text to speech output in a specific character's voice. All scripts generated both by 01 and 02 will be reviewed for completeness, and then further instructions will be given if necessary.
